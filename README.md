Welcome to the UAP/UFO/NHI disclosure party. If you are new, welcome. We have been tracking legislation, FOIA, and notable events for some years now. Here are my notes in chronological order.  https://public.amplenote.com/bhsdRVwHti333KHj9yzBg5zi 
Call your senators/reps. We need senate bill S2610 included in the 2025 NDAA. Everything else is a distraction. We need eminent domain and review panel language included in the 2025 NDAA.
