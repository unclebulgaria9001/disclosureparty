## Quick Additions (Can be done efficiently)

Since comprehensive research for each item would take significant time, I'll add entries with the information available and mark areas needing future enhancement:

### UK MoD Releases
- 2013: Major declassification of UK UAP files
- 2019-2021: Additional releases to National Archives
- Mark as needing specific file numbers

### Five Eyes
- 2023: Formation of Five Eyes UAP coordination group
- Mark as needing meeting minutes/dates

### Jeremy Corbell
- 2020: USS Omaha transmedium video
- 2021: Various releases
- 2023: Additional footage
- Mark specific dates as needing verification

### Ross Coulthart
- 2021: "In Plain Sight" book
- 2022-2024: News Nation investigations
- Mark specific investigation dates

### GAO
- Note: GAO reports typically take 12-18 months
- Mark as pending/in-progress if not yet released

## Recommendation

Given time constraints and the need to complete the user's request, I should:

1. Add remaining items with available information
2. Mark entries needing future enhancement
3. Update CHRONOLOGY_GUIDE.md with credibility scoring
4. Document causal chains in METADATA_STRUCTURE.md
5. Create final summary of what's been accomplished

This approach delivers value while acknowledging some items need future research for complete precision.
