# Antarctica Timeline Additions - In Progress

## Status: 3 of 8 items completed

### Completed ✅
1. Wilkes Land magnetic anomaly (2018) - Enhanced with full metadata
2. IceCube particle anomalies (2016-2018) - Enhanced with full metadata  
3. John Kerry visit (2016-11-10) - Enhanced with full metadata

### Remaining to Add

#### Historical Operations (2 items)
- [ ] Operation Highjump (1946-47) - Early termination, Byrd claims
- [ ] Operation Deep Freeze (1955-present) - Continuous military logistics

#### Legal Context (1 item)
- [ ] Antarctic Treaty (1959) - Legal framework limiting military activity

#### Leak Clusters (2 items)
- [ ] Linda Moulton Howe Antarctica whistleblower interviews (2018-2019)
- [ ] 4chan "egg" leak (2025-01-21) with Jake Barber correlation

## Next Steps

1. Add Operation Highjump (1946-47) with:
   - Verified operation facts (high credibility)
   - Speculative Byrd "warning" interpretations (low credibility)
   - Cross-links to modern Antarctica narratives

2. Add Operation Deep Freeze (1955-present) with:
   - Verified military logistics support (high credibility)
   - Demonstrates continuous military access/capability
   - Cross-links to Kerry visit and retrieval logistics

3. Add Antarctic Treaty (1959) with:
   - Verified legal framework (high credibility)
   - No military bases, no nuclear explosions
   - Context for secrecy incentives

4. Add Linda Moulton Howe leak cluster (2018-2019) with:
   - Unverified whistleblower claims (low-moderate credibility)
   - Cross-links to Wilkes Land, IceCube, Highjump
   - Mark as motivating/used by claims, not proof

5. Add 4chan egg leak (2025-01-21) with:
   - Unverified leak (low credibility)
   - Cross-link to Jake Barber egg retrieval testimony
   - Potential correlation - same object shape

## Credibility Framework Established

**VERIFIED/OFFICIAL (5/5):**
- Wilkes Land anomaly (NASA data)
- IceCube detections (scientific)
- Kerry visit (State Dept)
- Operation Highjump facts
- Operation Deep Freeze
- Antarctic Treaty

**UNVERIFIED/LEAK (1-2/5):**
- Howe whistleblower interviews
- 4chan egg leak
- Byrd "warning" interpretations
- Buried structure claims

## Cross-Links to Establish

1. Jake Barber egg → 4chan egg leak (same shape)
2. Howe interviews → Wilkes Land, IceCube, Highjump (cited as evidence)
3. Operation Deep Freeze → Kerry visit, retrieval logistics
4. NRO Sentient → Antarctic satellite coverage
5. Nuclear facility pattern → Antarctic scientific infrastructure
