**Details:**

After leaving active duty, he states that he contracted with the Department of Defense on sensitive retrieval operations, including missions involving UAP (Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena). His military background and subsequent work on classified operations serve as part of the support for his testimony. What are Barber’s primary claims regarding UAP crash retrievals? Answer: Barber claims that he and select helicopter teams conducted retrieval missions of anomalous objects that: Showed no visible propulsion or seams (for example, a white "egg" craft described as approximately 20 feet long and a separate "eight-gon" shaped disc). Appeared to materialize from unusual locations (such as near mountain ridges or emerging from underground). Were moved under high levels of secrecy to secure facilities; his responsibility ended after delivering the object to another team. Details include: Transport Method: Retrieval was performed using helicopters with long sling lines (approximately 150 to 200 feet) to minimize the effects of rotor wash. High Security: Mission briefings included instructions on using lethal force if adversaries attempted to seize the retrieved material. Limited Information on Final Handling: Barber did not receive further details on what happened to the objects after delivery.

Key Takeaways from November 13 2024 Hearings:
\* Certain unnamed individuals did not want this hearing to happen, fearing what may be disclosed, says Rep Nancy Mace
\* Mace says there has been an outright refusal to share classified information or cooperate by certain agencies with Congress
\* Mace says AARO is struggling and unable or unwilling to bring forward the truth regarding UAP
\* Mace says if there is "no there there" - then why are we spending money on it, and why can't we see how much money we are spending on it (citing AARO budget as example)
\* Mace says program uncovered which may have been illegally kept from Congressional oversight
\* 12-page report from Shellenberger on Immaculate Constellation collection program entered into record, passed around to members
\* Garcia says this is about "the truth, the science, and facts".
\* Grothman particularly concerned about Langley airspace incursions, cites radar readings
\* Grothman says "we cannot shy away from the unknown especially when the stakes are so high".
\* Moskowitz says "some of us (panel members) were told not to ask you (witnesses) certain questions".
\* Gallaudet says he has seen imagery of disk-shaped object that is classified, can't talk about agency which has it unless in classified setting
\* Elizondo says he has NDA which restricts discussing crash retrievals - provided from the US Govt specifically DOD
\* Elizondo says US has craft retrieval programs and reverse engineering programs
\* Elizondo says US Govt is paying veterans for injuries sustained due to UAP related injuries but Pentagon denies existence of UAP
\* Shellenberger says US military industrial complex sitting on a mountain of data and information relating to UAP, high-resolution, potentially thousands of files - says some of the source collection that is classified is shot from helicopters using unclassified collection platforms
\* Gallaudet says congress should have all information related to the tic-tac incident, speculates that Pentagon doesn't want to share data because it shows weaknesses in our defenses
\* Gallaudet says AARO tried to convince him verified UAP reports weren't actually UAP (that they were American technology), they questioned him, and tried to tell him other whistleblowers weren't credible
\* Elizondo says enough data to suggest relationship between sensitive US military / nuclear installations and heavy UAP activity - going back decades
\* Elizondo says he agrees with Grusch - UAP programs operating without congressional oversight.
\* "Career Psychological operations officer" as the main point of contact at the Pentagon for all things UAP, individual also worked with previous AARO leadership (Kirkpatrick)
\* Gallaudet speculates author (superior) of email was silenced and an intel agency was involved (cites "spillage"
\* Gallaudet says a USO in the 80's exhibited characteristics of Russian torpedo, but approached nuclear submarine then slowed, followed for a few minutes, then rapidly exited the scene
\* Gallaudet and Elizondo says AARO and DOD involved in misinformation campaigns against whistleblowers
\* Shellenberger says author of Immaculate Constellation report is either a current or former government official - and doesn't know where the "unofficial" report on Immaculate Constellation might be
\* Elizondo says craft shaped could be origin-related but could also be a "matter of utility"
\* Greene notes that there must be a great deal of research and study behind report to be able to know how injuries from certain types of craft experiences differ from others - Shellenberger confirms huge database, says that a single-source told him USAP managed within DOD somewhere but "held" at the White House (I speculate, via NSC?)
\* Gallaudet says USOs have outpaced US submarines by orders of magnitude
\* Elizondo says UAP are intelligently controlled as in certain military cases UAP anticipate human maneuvers and also "stalk" US Navy ships
\* Elizondo says UAP have been recorded moving in excess of 2000 - 3000 Gs.
\* Luna speculates there are "good and bad" of whatever they are and posits how does that tie into religion, religious individuals who have experiences. No one answers.
\* All witnesses agree that aspects of the federal government are knowingly concealing information on UAPs from the general public.
\* "Non-Human, Higher Intelligence" is personal conclusion on majority of UAP reports from Gallaudet and Elizondo.
\* Biggs questions for what reason the government is over-classifying UAP information; Elizondo touts cold war, adversaries, philosophical narratives on national defense. Biggs says "it's too painful for them to admit".
\* Gold says "all breakthroughs are heretical"
\* Elizondo says Lockheed (didn't mention contractor name, but we know this via other sources) had craft material from 1950s and tried to divest to USAP, but this divestiture was blocked, Air Force nor SecDef never provided memo necessary - Elizondo can't comment on where those materials are today, says it's up to the gatekeepers still within the US Govt
\* Elizondo says we have biological samples but those particular biological samples were collected before he was born, and that those biologics are "separate but related" to aforementioned craft materials allegedly held by Lockheed
\* Elizondo agrees that UAP incursions are becoming more and more "brash" and "provocative". Discusses heightened awareness by military assets, better sensor capabilities for recording and analysis.
\* Timmons speculates that it's either China or Non-Human, "China has technology we don't understand, and if it's non-human, we don't know intent".
\* Elizondo can't answer whether there are any technologies of non-human origin tied in with "advanced bio-science defense programs within the USG"
\* None of the witnesses mention being familiar with non-human genetic / hybridization programs.
\* Shellenberger says information on USOs being withheld from other areas of government, discusses orbs entering and exiting ocean
\* Elizondo says US has foreign material programs when asked if we share information on UAP with international partners
\* Regarding materials given to US Contractors, example of General Dynamics for underwater propulsion, Lockheed Martin for aerospace - but Elizondon says "no, I didn't say Lockheed doesn't do submerged" - gets flustered, says Lockheed Martin can explain which domains they are involved in
\* Gold says we are looking for intelligence that might be biological, but we need to be prepared that it might not be. Discusses technological life, artificial intelligence, machine learning.
\* Ogles mentions Oak Ridge UAP incident. Elizondo speculates on military site interest - Savannah River, Los Alamos, a lot of sensitive R&D sites have had UAP incursions. This is where our most advanced scientific concepts originate. Sees this as a form of reconnaissance on adversarial capability.
\* Gallaudet says cover-up is unconstitutional (in fewer words) and infringes on congressional oversight - "greatest issue of our time is being hid from you (congress)".
\* Ogles says "it is clear from your experiences, and from what I have seen, that there is something out there".

## 2024, May 30 - A UK Freedom of Information request has revealed the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) is currently researching how it will react to the so-called ‘black swan’ event that is discovering extraterrestrial life, including announcing the find to the public. #LegislationPolicy #FOIARelease #GovernmentPreparedness #International #ScientificStudies #ReligiousCultural #Europe #UnitedKingdom

A black swan event is unpredictable and has wide-ranging consequences, but in hindsight, it appears to have been inevitable. The report is investigating whether a plan already exists – none has ever been made public – what a plan would look like, and how the UK can be ‘on the front foot’ should s...

## 2024, May 21 - "Non-human intelligence exists. Non-human intelligence has been interacting with humanity. This interaction is not new and has been ongoing." - Karl Nell, retired Army Colonel. #WhistleblowerDisclosures #PublicTalk #NonHumanIntelligence #UAPDisclosure #UAPCaucus #MilitaryEncounters #USA

Alex Klokus interviewed Colonel Karl Nell at SALT iConnections New York, where Knell discussed evidence of non-human intelligence on earth. He detailed the U.S. government's level of knowledge and its disclosure process. Knell says there's zero doubt non-human intelligent life has visited Earth a...

**Details:**

1. The speaker, Karl Nell, believes that non-human intelligence exists and has been interacting with humanity. This is not a new phenomenon, and there are people within the government who are aware of it. 
1. Evidence for this belief comes from key figures with high-level access to information, such as Paul Hellyer, Ham Eshed, Chris Mellon, Lou Elizondo, and David Grush. All of them have stated similar beliefs regarding the existence of non-human intelligence.
1. The government has not officially disclosed this information for six main reasons: national security, lack of a plan, potential societal disruption, potential non-public agreements, potential misdeeds and cover-ups, and basic organizational intransigence. 
1. Despite these reasons, Karl Nell believes that disclosure should still occur for three reasons: people have a moral right to know, being proactive is better than being reactive, and societal advancement and global competitiveness could benefit from more people being aware of this topic.
1. Karl Nell warns of the possibility of "catastrophic disclosure," where the truth is forced out in a way that could cause societal upheaval. He suggests that the world could be in a state similar to the collapse of the Bronze Age, where civilizations failed due to stressors they couldn't handle.
1. The intentions of non-human intelligence are unknown. Karl Nell suggests that their intentions might be driven by the same Darwinian evolutionary process that governs life on Earth, making it naive to expect either complete altruism or malintent.
1. Karl Nell suggests that disclosure is not inevitable, given that previous cycles of interest in disclosure have come and gone. However, he hopes that recent legislative efforts, such as the Schumer Amendment, could lead to more progress in this area.
1. The phenomenon of non-human intelligence is a global issue, not just a U.S. issue. Therefore, it would be beneficial for nations to work collectively on this.
1. Karl Nell believes that humanity can pursue an understanding of the ultimate truth, which includes understanding non-human intelligence. This pursuit is part of our existence.
1. The speaker also indicates that there might be a race to reverse-engineer alien technology, as it could provide a strategic advantage to the nation that accomplishes it first. However, he also acknowledges the potential instability that could come with such a transition.

## 2023, April 17 - Tim Gallaudet, an oceanographer and former Naval rear admiral who served as the author of a March white paper about so-called "unidentified submerged objects" or USOs, told Fox News this week that he considers it both "scientifically valid" and critical to national security to study these phenomena. #LeaksDeclass #Conspiracy #OceanUAP #LARPing #Debunked #UnderwaterUSO (if used) #USA

Released by the newly-convened Sol Foundation, a think tank dedicated to studying what the military calls "unidentified anomalous phenomena" (UAPs), the 29-page report centers on a 2019 video taken aboard the Omaha off the coast of San Diego. The video, which was leaked to filmmaker Jeremy Corbel...

![Aaro Historical Record Report Volume 1 1](images/2024-aaro-historical-record-report-volume-1-1.jpg)

**Details:**

- AARO found no empirical evidence to support claims that the USG and private companies have reverse-engineered extraterrestrial technology. Based on all information provided to date, AARO determined that claims involving specific people, known locations, technological tests, and documents allegedly involved in or related to this activity are inaccurate. Additional claims will be addressed in Volume II. 
    - Correct, there are no claims of reverse engineering for extraterrestrial technology.
- AARO assesses that all of the named and described alleged hidden UAP reverse-engineering programs provided by interviewees either do not exist, are misidentified authentic, highly sensitive national security programs that are not related to extraterrestrial technology exploitation, or resolve to an unwarranted and disestablished program
    - Again, careful use of extraterrestrial term
- AARO assesses that the inaccurate claim that the USG is reverse-engineering extraterrestrial technology and is hiding it from Congress is, in large part, the result of circular reporting from a group of individuals who believe this to be the case, despite the lack of any evidence.
    - Again, careful use of extraterrestrial term
- AARO assesses that UAP sightings, reports of these sightings to USG organizations, and claims that some UAP constitute extraterrestrial craft and that the USG has secured and is experimenting with extraterrestrial technology have been influenced by a range of cultural, political, and technological factors.
    - Again, careful use of extraterrestrial term
- Several factors—domestic and international—most likely influenced sightings, reports, and some individuals' belief that there is sufficient proof that some UAP represent extraterrestrial technology.
    - Again, careful use of extraterrestrial terms and the word "some."
- AARO assesses that some portion of sightings since the 1940s have represented misidentification of never-before-seen experimental and operational space, rocket, and air systems, including stealth technologies and the proliferation of drone platforms
    - Again, the use of the word "some."

### Background
According to Grusch (and many other sources), the Atomic Energy Act was used to classify UAP back in the day. They used this legal definition to shove UAPs in there conveniently:
Such material is capable of releasing substantial quantities of atomic energy. The president can't legally declassify or disclose anything that falls under that act:
Some secrets, such as information related to nuclear weapons, are handled separately under a specific statutory scheme that Congress has adopted under the Atomic Energy Act. The president cannot automatically declassify those secrets alone and must, by law, consult extensively with executive branch agencies.
This is why Schumer's UAPDA was required to give the president that legal right. The UAPDA even called out The Atomic Energy Act as an obstacle (Before they gutted it)
Legislation is necessary because credible evidence and testimony indicate that Federal Government unidentified anomalous phenomena records exist that have not been declassified or subject to mandatory declassification review as set forth in Executive Order 13526 (50 U.S.C. 3161 note; relating to classified national security information) due in part to exemptions under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.) It also includes an over-broad interpretation of ‘‘trans-classified foreign nuclear information,’’ which is also exempt from mandatory declassification, thereby preventing public disclosure under existing provisions of law.
### Timeline
- Day 0 (Dec 22, 2023): Archivist preps ID form.
- Day 45 (Feb 5, 2024): Archivist collects uap recs.
- Day 60 (Feb 20, 2024): Government office preps recs.
- Day 300 (Oct 18, 2024): Recs ready for publication.
- Day 330 post-transmit (Nov 17, 2024): Inspection at the National Archive begins.
- Day 540 (Jun 20, 2025): Records available online.
- If postponed, Congress must be notified within 15 days.
- All records must be published within 25 years maximum.
- There are limits on unreported SAP programs.
The archivist preps the ID form on Day 0 (Dec 22, 2023) and collects uap recs on Day 45 (Feb 5, 2024). On Day 60 (Feb 20, 2024), the Government office preps recs. After Day 300 (Oct 18, 2024), the recs are ready for publication. Inspection at the National Archive begins on Day 330 post-transmit (Nov 17, 2024). On Day 540 (Jun 20, 2025), the records become available online. If postponed, Congress must be notified within 15 days. All records must be published within a maximum of 25 years, and there are limits on unreported SAP programs.
### Summary
- Limitations on Use of Funds for Unreported Programs: No funds can be used to support activities involving unidentified anomalous phenomena unless the Secretary of Defense provides details to the appropriate congressional committees and leadership. This applies to activities described in the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office's 2024 fiscal year report.
- Independent Research and Development: Funding related to unidentified anomalous phenomena cannot be considered as indirect expenses for contracts covered by Department of Defense Instruction Number 3204.01. However, such information can be made available to the appropriate congressional committees and leadership.
- Definitions: Terms such as "appropriate congressional committees," "congressional leadership", and "unidentified anomalous phenomena" are clearly defined.
- Establishment of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Records Collection: The Archivist is to establish a collection of unidentified anomalous phenomena records in the National Archives. The collection will consist of all government, government-provided, or government-funded records relating to unidentified anomalous phenomena and equivalent subjects.
- Disclosure of Records: All unidentified anomalous phenomena records transmitted to the National Archives for public disclosure will be included in the Collection and made available to the public.
- Fees for Copying: The Archivist will charge fees for copying unidentified anomalous phenomena records, with the amount not exceeding the actual expenses incurred by the National Archives in making and providing the copy.
- Review, Identification, Transmission to the National Archives, and Public Disclosure of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Records by Government Offices: Each head of a Government office is to identify, organize, and prepare for transmission records relating to unidentified anomalous phenomena to the Archivist for inclusion in the Collection.
- Grounds for Postponement of Public Disclosure of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Records: Disclosure of these records may be postponed if there is clear and convincing evidence that the threat to the military defense, intelligence operations, or conduct of foreign relations of the United States posed by the public disclosure outweighs the public interest in disclosure.
- Funding Limitations Relating to Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: No funds can be used in support of any activity involving unidentified anomalous phenomena unless the Director of National Intelligence has provided the details of the activity to the appropriate committees of Congress and congressional leadership.
### Timeline
- Enactment of the Act: This is the starting point of the timeline. The specific date will depend on when the Act is officially passed into law.
- Within 45 days of enactment, The Archivist prepares and makes available to all Government offices a standard form of identification for use with each record (Sec. 1842).
- No later than 60 days after enactment: The Archivist commences the establishment of a collection of unidentified anomalous phenomena records at the National Archives (Sec. 1841).
- As soon as practicable after enactment, Each head of a government office begins to identify, organize, and prepare for transmission of the records in their possession (Sec. 1842).
- Not later than 300 days after enactment: Each head of a Government office completes the review, identification, and organization of each record for public disclosure and transmission (Sec. 1842).
- Records are available to the public for inspection and copying at the National Archives within 30 days of their transmission (Sec. 1841).
- Records are available digitally via the National Archives online database within 180 days of their transmission (Sec. 1841).
- If disclosure is postponed, The head of the Executive agency notifies congressional leadership and the oversight committees of Congress within 15 days of such decision (Sec. 1843).
- No later than 25 years after the date of the first creation of the record: Each record shall be publicly disclosed in full (Sec. 1842).
- Fiscal year 2024: Limitations on the use of funds for certain unreported programs involving unidentified anomalous phenomena come into effect (Sec. 1687, Sec. 7343).
### Analysis
See threads and discussions for links to source materials. 
- 😀 Sec. 1005—Requirement for unqualified opinion on Department of Defense financial statement - Requires the DOD to get a clean audit by 2028.
- 😀 Sec. 1687. Limitation on use of funds for certain unreported programs - Gillibrand Amendment - prohibits funds from being used on any UAP programs unless disclosed to Congressional leadership and Intel and Armed Services Committees. This also covers IRADs.
- 🤔 Sec. 1841. Unidentified anomalous phenomena records collection at the National Archives and Records Administration—Parts of Schumer/Rounds—Establishes a collection of records in the National Archives for UAP records. The Senate Homeland Security, Armed Services, and Intel Committees, together with the House Oversight, Armed Services, and Intel Committees, have oversight. 
- 😒 Sec 1842. Sec. 1842. Review, identification, transmission to the National Archives, and public disclosure of unidentified anomalous phenomena records by government offices - More of Schumer/Rounds - Each governmental office holding UAP records must identify all UAP records and send them to the National Archives. There is no review board. However, there is a requirement that each document must be disclosed in full within 25 years of its creation unless the President certifies that there would be identifiable harm to national security and that outweighs the public interest in disclosure.
- 😡 Sec 1843. Grounds for postponement of public disclosure of unidentified anomalous phenomena records - Contains some additional circumstances under which particular records can be withheld from disclosure when they involve grave harm to national security and reveal sources and methods.
- ☹️ There's a lot more to Sections 1841-3, as they are quite complex and will require further analysis in the coming days. They are far short of what we want, but we shouldn't be blind to any benefits contained within them.
- 😀 Section 7343. Funding limitations relating to unidentified anomalous phenomena. - largely a repeat of Section 1687
- 🤔 Sections 7601-6 contain broad reforms to the laws on classification that will require further analysis. It may have an impact on UAP secrecy issues. Previously mentioned it here: https://x.com/CuriousNHI/status/1695792419864813837?s=20
- 🤔 Sec. 7801-4. Improved funding flexibility for payments made by the Central Intelligence Agency for qualifying injuries to the brain contains provisions related to assisting those subject to anomalous health incidents (i.e., possible UAP or Havana syndrome). More analysis is required, but previously covered this here: https://x.com/CuriousNHI/status/1695792420993069266?s=20
- 😤 It also appears that they took out reforms of the IC IG whistleblower process that were in part or wholly inspired by some of the issues David Grusch had.

If the Senate passes the yearly NDAA bill and Congress creates and passes a different version of the bill. how do the two get reconciled? This is the National Defence bill

**Details:**

Division -> Title -> Subtitle -> Part -> Section
As I understand it, Burchett’s Bill is to be added to the end of Subtitle G, of Title X, of Division A. Namely:
Division A: Department of Defense Authorizations
Title X: General Provisions
Subtitle G: Other Matters
This is the only “Subtitle G” of a “Title A” that I could find in the entire document, so I assume this is the portion of the NDAA that Burchett is referring to.
The existing UAP Disclosure Act has an entire Division dedicated to it, namely:
Division G: Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Disclosure
Based on this understanding of the NDAA, Burchett’s addition to the bill didn't seem intended to replace the Senate UAP Disclosure Act, regardless of what Gaetz’s tweet implied.
AMENDMENT TO RULES COMMITTEE PRINT 118- 10 OFFERED BY MR. BURCHETT OF TENNESSEE At the end of subtitle G of title X, add the following new section: 1 SEC. 10ll.

 The origins of this release remain a mystery. There are two main possibilities: either CBP took the initiative to proactively disclose these materials to the public, or they were released as a result of a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. The Black Vault currently has multiple FOIA cases with CBP. Some of these requests were transferred to other agencies, while others remain open with CBP.

**Details:** 
Ryan Graves, the Executive Director of Americans for Safe Aerospace, emphasizes the regularity and seriousness of UFO sightings in restricted airspace off the Atlantic Coast. He stresses the need for serious investigation and acknowledgement of potential threats posed by these unidentified objects. Commander David Fravor, a former U.S. Navy pilot, recounts a UFO encounter in 2004 involving a white Tic Tac-shaped object exhibiting unconventional behaviour. Fravor believes it should be studied more closely for technological insights. David Grusch, a former USAF officer and intelligence official, claims the U.S. government possesses non-human spacecraft and deceased pilots through a secretive UFO recovery program. He alleges government involvement with the Vatican and the Five Eyes. A congressional hearing on UFOs revealed that around 95% of sightings go unreported due to stigma, and suggestions were made to use existing NASA databases to track sightings with actual sensor footage. The hearing emphasized the serious nature of the issue, acknowledging the presence of career officers with decades of experience and the commitment to transparency and pressure on the matter.

## 2023, June - Karl E. Nell is a possible first-hand witness. “His assertion concerning the existence of a terrestrial arms race occurring sub-rosa over the past eighty years focused on reverse engineering technologies of unknown origin is fundamentally correct, as is the indisputable realization that at least some of these technologies of unknown origin derive from non-human intelligence,” said Karl Nell, the retired Army Colonel who worked with Grusch on the UAP Task Force. #usadc #USA

Karl E. Nell, a recently retired Army Colonel and current aerospace executive who was the Army’s liaison for the UAP Task Force from 2021 to 2022 and worked with Grusch there, characterizes Grusch as “beyond reproach.""

## 2023, February 14 - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau received a secret memo laying out how the Canadian government was responding to the Feb. 11 Yukon incident. In addition, it stated the "full exploitation" of whatever the U.S. Air Force shot down over the waters of Alaska on Feb. 10 had "not yet been completed." Reports a few days later stated that the U.S. had called off the search for the wreckage of the downed object. Exactly what kind of intelligence exploitation this is referring to is unclear. UAP #MilitaryEncounters #20 #new  (2023-09-10) #canada #usa

The "Memorandum for the Prime Minister," transmitted Feb. 14. The memo expressed concern that the indigenous hunters might accidentally find the object during their caribou hunt.

## 2021, June 25 - ODNI Preliminary Assessment on UAP Released to Congress #OfficialReport #CongressionalMandated #144Observations #PolicyDriver #USA

The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) released the "Preliminary Assessment: Unidentified Aerial Phenomena" report to Congress, mandated by the FY2021 Intelligence Authorization Act. The unclassified report analyzed 144 UAP observations by U.S. Armed Forces personnel from November 2004 to March 2021. Key findings: (1) 80 observations involved multiple sensors, (2) 18 incidents displayed unusual flight characteristics (remaining stationary in high winds, moving against wind, maneuvering abruptly, moving at considerable speed without discernible propulsion), (3) 143 remained unexplained, only 1 identified with high confidence (deflating balloon), (4) UAP "clearly pose a safety of flight issue and may pose a challenge to U.S. national security." The report identified five potential explanatory categories: airborne clutter, natural atmospheric phenomena, USG or industry programs, foreign adversary systems, and "Other." The assessment explicitly stated more data was needed and drove congressional demands for enhanced reporting, leading directly to expanded NDAA requirements, AARO establishment with broader mandate, and increased funding for UAP investigation.

**Event Type**: Official_Report, Congressional_Mandate, Intelligence_Assessment
**Credibility**: 5/5 (Official ODNI report to Congress, mandated by law, multi-agency coordination)
**Primary Actors**: Avril Haines (DNI), ODNI, UAPTF, Navy, FBI, multiple IC agencies
**Agencies**: ODNI, UAPTF, Navy, Air Force, FBI, DIA, NGA, NRO
**Sensor Type**: Multiple sensors (radar, FLIR, EO, visual), 80 incidents with multi-sensor data
**Related Events**:
- RESPONDS_TO → 2020-2021 NDAA UAP reporting requirements (evidence: congressionally mandated report)
- ENABLED_BY → 2019-04-24 Navy reporting guidelines (evidence: increased reporting fed 144-observation dataset)
- ENABLED_BY → 2020-08-04 UAPTF establishment (evidence: UAPTF conducted analysis)
- CAUSES → 2022 expanded NDAA UAP provisions (evidence: congressional record cites report's data gaps)
- CAUSES → 2022-07-20 AARO establishment (evidence: report's recommendations drove broader mandate)
- CAUSES → 2022-2023 congressional hearings surge (evidence: members cite report in hearing statements)
**Causal Chain**: Media_Political_Legislative_Chain_1, Incidents_Security_Policy_Chain_3
**Immediate Outcomes**: Legitimized UAP as national security concern; identified data gaps; drove legislative action
**Policy Impact**: Expanded NDAA requirements; AARO creation with enhanced authorities; increased IC coordination; normalized UAP investigation
**Evidence Strength**: Strong (5/5) - Official IC product, clear causal links to downstream legislation, explicit congressional citations

## 2020, April 27 - DoD Officially Confirms Authenticity of Navy UAP Videos #OfficialConfirmation #NavyUAP #VideoEvidence #PolicyShift #USA

The Department of Defense officially released and confirmed the authenticity of three Navy UAP videos (FLIR1/Nimitz 2004, Gimbal 2015, GoFast 2015) previously leaked and published by the New York Times in December 2017. Pentagon spokesperson Sue Gough stated: "The Department of Defense is releasing the videos in order to clear up any misconceptions by the public on whether or not the footage that has been circulating was real, or whether or not there is more to the videos. The aerial phenomena observed in the videos remain characterized as 'unidentified.'" This official acknowledgment marked a significant policy shift, legitimizing the UAP phenomenon publicly and increasing congressional pressure for transparency. The confirmation directly enabled subsequent legislative action including NDAA UAP provisions, UAPTF establishment, and eventual AARO creation. This represented the first time in decades the DoD publicly acknowledged unidentified aerial phenomena as a genuine unknown requiring investigation.

**Event Type**: Official_Confirmation, Policy_Shift, Video_Evidence
**Credibility**: 5/5 (Official DoD statement, authenticated videos, Pentagon spokesperson on record)
**Primary Actors**: Sue Gough (Pentagon spokesperson), DoD Public Affairs
**Agencies**: DoD, Navy

- CAUSES → 2020-08-04 UAPTF establishment (evidence: DoD statement preceded formal task force by 3 months)
- ENABLES → 2020-2021 NDAA UAP provisions (evidence: congressional record cites official confirmation)
**Causal Chain**: Media_Political_Legislative_Chain_1
**Immediate Outcomes**: Public legitimization of UAP phenomenon; increased congressional inquiries; media coverage surge
**Policy Impact**: Enabled UAPTF creation; contributed to NDAA reporting requirements; shifted DoD public posture on UAP
**Evidence Strength**: Strong (5/5) - Official DoD release, clear temporal precedence to downstream legislative action

## 2019, April 24 - Navy Establishes New UAP Reporting Guidelines #MilitaryPolicy #ReportingProcedures #StigmaReduction #USA

The U.S. Navy established formal guidelines for pilots and personnel to report Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) encounters, marking a significant policy shift following increased public and congressional attention from the 2017 NYT AATIP disclosure. Navy spokesperson Joseph Gradisher stated the new reporting mechanism was created because "there have been a number of reports of unauthorized and/or unidentified aircraft entering various military-controlled ranges and designated air space in recent years." The guidelines aimed to reduce stigma around UAP reporting, standardize data collection, and ensure proper threat assessment. This policy change directly responded to pilot concerns about lack of formal reporting channels and represented the Navy's acknowledgment that UAP encounters posed potential safety and security issues requiring systematic investigation. The guidelines contributed to increased UAP reporting that informed the 2021 ODNI Preliminary Assessment.

**Event Type**: Military_Policy, Reporting_Procedures, Stigma_Reduction
**Credibility**: 5/5 (Official Navy policy, spokesperson on record, documented in military communications)
**Primary Actors**: Joseph Gradisher (Navy spokesperson), Navy leadership
**Agencies**: U.S. Navy, DoD
**Related Events**:
- RESPONDS_TO → 2017-12-16 NYT AATIP disclosure (evidence: Navy statements cite increased attention)
- RESPONDS_TO → 2017-10-11 TTSA formation (evidence: pilot advocacy from Elizondo/Mellon)
- ENABLES → 2021-06-25 ODNI Preliminary Assessment (evidence: new reports fed into 144-observation dataset)
- CORRELATES_WITH → 2019 increased congressional inquiries (evidence: timing with Senate briefings)
**Causal Chain**: Media_Political_Legislative_Chain_1, Incidents_Security_Policy_Chain_3
**Immediate Outcomes**: Reduced reporting stigma; standardized UAP data collection; increased pilot reports
**Policy Impact**: Enabled systematic UAP investigation; contributed to UAPTF establishment; informed ODNI assessment
**Evidence Strength**: Strong (5/5) - Official Navy policy, direct causal link to downstream reporting increase

## 2018-2019 - Linda Moulton Howe Antarctica Whistleblower Interviews #WhistleblowerDisclosures #Antarctica #USA

Investigative journalist Linda Moulton Howe conducted a series of interviews with alleged military personnel and contractors claiming knowledge of unusual discoveries and activities in Antarctica. The interviews, published between 2018 and 2019, featured multiple sources describing encounters with anomalous craft, unusual structures beneath the ice, and classified operations in restricted zones of the continent. Sources claimed to have witnessed disc-shaped craft emerging from or entering the ice, advanced technology inconsistent with known human capabilities, and extensive underground facilities. While the accounts remain unverified and sources maintained anonymity citing security concerns, the interviews have contributed to ongoing speculation about classified Antarctic operations. Howe's reporting emphasized the consistency of certain details across independent sources and the professional backgrounds of the alleged witnesses.

## 2018 - NASA Discovers Massive Magnetic Anomaly Beneath Antarctica #ScientificStudies #Antarctica #International

NASA scientists discovered a massive magnetic anomaly beneath the ice in Wilkes Land, East Antarctica. The anomaly, detected through satellite and aerial surveys, spans an area larger than Paris and suggests the presence of a massive metallic object or geological formation beneath the ice sheet. Initial analysis indicated the anomaly could be a massive impact crater from an asteroid strike, potentially dating back millions of years. The crater's size and the magnetic signature suggest an object approximately 300 kilometers in diameter may be buried beneath the ice. Alternative theories have proposed unusual geological formations or concentrations of metallic minerals. The discovery has sparked interest due to the anomaly's size, depth, and the difficulty of conducting direct investigation beneath kilometers of ice.

## 2017,  March 27 - Anonymous website partially encoded publishes an article on “turning the vehicle into a pilot’s prosthetic extension.” In the article are vague examples of how to replicate the piloting features of a UAP: “there must be no difference between the aircraft and the crew…you cannot just take a human being and fit him with all this array of sensors; you first need to tweak the human somehow to better exploit the capabilities of this technology…we need to go a step further from the current paradigm of manned aircrafts and shift toward a paradigm of aircrafts that behave like a human.” Elsewhere on the site, allegedly non-public reports from Raytheon and Lockheed are cited. #news #rumor #usa

## 2017, December 16 - New York Times Reveals AATIP and Releases Navy UAP Videos #MediaDisclosure #AATIP #NavyUAP #Whistleblower #PoliticalPressure #USA

The New York Times published "Glowing Auras and 'Black Money': The Pentagon's Mysterious U.F.O. Program" by Helene Cooper, Ralph Blumenthal, and Leslie Kean, revealing the existence of the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP) and releasing three Navy UAP videos (FLIR1/Nimitz 2004, Gimbal 2015, GoFast 2015). The article disclosed that the $22 million program, funded at the request of Senator Harry Reid, operated from 2007-2012 within the Defense Intelligence Agency. Luis Elizondo, former AATIP director, resigned in protest over excessive secrecy and lack of resources, then joined To The Stars Academy to facilitate disclosure. This article catalyzed mainstream UAP coverage, legitimized the topic for serious discussion, and directly led to increased congressional pressure for transparency, Navy reporting guideline updates, and eventual creation of UAPTF and AARO. The videos showed objects performing maneuvers beyond known aerospace capabilities, captured by multiple military sensor systems.

**Event Type**: Media_Leak, Program_Disclosure, Whistleblower
**Credibility**: 5/5 (Major newspaper, multiple named sources, DoD confirmation, official videos)
**Primary Actors**: Helene Cooper (NYT), Ralph Blumenthal (NYT), Leslie Kean (NYT), Luis Elizondo (AATIP Director/Whistleblower), Harry Reid (Senator), Christopher Mellon (former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense)

## 2017, October 11 - To The Stars Academy (TTSA) Publicly Launched #Organization #Whistleblower #MediaDisclosure #PoliticalBridge #USA

To The Stars Academy of Arts & Science (TTSA) was publicly launched by Tom DeLonge with a team of former government and military officials including Luis Elizondo (former AATIP director), Christopher Mellon (former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence), Dr. Hal Puthoff (physicist), Jim Semivan (former CIA), and Steve Justice (former Lockheed Skunk Works). TTSA positioned itself as a bridge between whistleblowers, media, and government, facilitating UAP disclosure through public education, congressional briefings, and media releases. The organization played a crucial role in the 2017-2020 disclosure wave by: (1) providing institutional support for whistleblowers like Elizondo, (2) briefing Senate committees and helping "glue" DoD, IC, and Congress together (per DeLonge 2019), (3) releasing UAP videos and documentation, and (4) creating public pressure for government transparency. TTSA's activities directly enabled congressional action on UAP issues and contributed to UAPTF establishment and NDAA provisions.

## 2016, March 27 - Tom DeLonge states in early 2016 that he was told by his CIA “advisors” that when UAP crashes happen, intelligence, military and private industry are pooled together. “They’ve” been using private companies/publicly traded companies to keep the secret information “protected” through non-governmental organizations. DeLonge states he has been told how public perception on UAP has been shaped by private interests and his “advisors” review his publicly disseminated information. DeLonge also states he met with the CIA (2015?). DeLonge also states the MJ-12 documents are not accurate and in reality, things are much more complex. #rumor #contentdeleted #usa

## 2016, November - Secretary of State John Kerry Visits Antarctica #Antarctica #USA

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry visited Antarctica in November 2016, becoming the highest-ranking U.S. government official to visit the continent. The visit occurred during the final weeks of the Obama administration and coincided with the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Kerry's trip included visits to McMurdo Station and the South Pole, where he met with scientists and researchers studying climate change. The unusual timing of the visit, during a critical election period, sparked speculation about the true purpose of the trip. Official statements emphasized climate research and international cooperation under the Antarctic Treaty, but the visit has remained a subject of interest in UAP research communities due to its timing and the high-level nature of the delegation.

## 2016 - IceCube Neutrino Observatory Detects Unusual Particles #ScientificStudies #Antarctica #International

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory, located at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station in Antarctica, detected unusual high-energy particle events between 2016 and 2018. The detector observed particles that appeared to be traveling upward through the Earth, rather than downward from space as expected. These anomalous detections suggested particles were either passing through the entire planet or originating from within Earth itself, challenging conventional physics models. The IceCube facility consists of over 5,000 optical sensors embedded deep in Antarctic ice, designed to detect neutrinos from cosmic sources. While scientists have proposed various explanations including exotic particle physics, the anomalous readings have not been fully explained and continue to be studied.

## 2016 - New UFO image declassified by Department of Defense. #FOIA #iraq #MiddleEast

The Department of Defense has declassified a new UFO image showing a metallic-looking orb flying over Mosul, Iraq. The image was taken by a US spy plane in April 2016 and was part of a classified briefing video on UFOs presented to various US government agencies.

## 2015, November 5 - The National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) states in response to a FOIA request that it has no documentation related to UFOs. It states the topic is “outside of the scope of NRO responsibilities; furthermore, the NRO has conducted numerous searches…in the past, and has located no records.” This contradicts emails released by the NRO on 8 April 2022, which show extensive coordination with the DOD’s Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force (UAPTF), and states the NRO contributed to the UAPTF report to Congress “tied to its collection efforts.” This implies UAP are being detected on NRO platforms, and suggests the FOIA response in 2015 wasn’t accurate if they were being detected in 2015 or before. #FOIA #usa

Note: The emails also reveal the DOD Inspector General (DOD/IG) interviewed several officers from the NRO Mission Integration Directorate (MID) connected to the IG’s evaluation of DOD handling/response to the UAP subject.

## 2015, March 13 - Kit Green states the records of Ret. USAF John Burroughs, Rendlesham Forest incident witness, were legally classified by the DOD. Green states only a handful of medical records were classified and the reasons were because inside the doctors notes, nursing, etc. are a “myriad of references to Special Access Projects” and the names of other adjacent and ancillary programs and projects that can not be disentangled and could uncover active/recent projects related to Rendlesham. Green states broadband non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation caused the injuries, the data is sparse and it is not well understood or peer reviewed. #HistoricalPreModern? #FOIA #ClassifiedRecords #Rendlesham #UAPRecordsCollection #USA

## 2015, March 6 - Former USG contractor Bob Fish tells Clinton campaign manager John Podesta that in a TS/SCI organization in El Segundo, CA, he had lunch with a senior USAF NCO who worked for Project Blue Book in the 1970s after it had publicly disbanded. He was an ELINT technician who flew in RC-135s from MacDill AFB in Florida. He allegedly told Fish they were sometimes diverted to track UAP off the east coast of Florida; the UAP allegedly came from a hotspot east of Miami, north of Bermuda. A specific frequency emanated from them, and UAP evidence was sent to a “dedicated” USAF intelligence officer. #rumor #wiki #ysacalifornia #USA

Herrington also allegedly stated the existence of extraterrestrials were the “tip of the iceberg” in terms of the revelations he learned related to the issue.

## 2011, June - DHS officials Jim Bell and Sacha Mover begin a series of other meetings in the U.S. intelligence community beyond DHS to determine if they can set up BAASS as a UAP analysis program within DHS Science & Technology (S&T). Those men are the “keepers of the secrets,” who treat Bell and Mover rudely and told “no, and hell no” when asked. Bell and Mover later told BAASS that they believed advanced technology was being held at aerospace contractor facilities under government supervision. Mover and Bell became fearful of moving forward. By late 2011, DHS Deputy Secretary Jane Holl Lute, Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis Phyllis Green, and others decided not to contract BAASS within DHS. #LegislationPolicy #AgencyCoordination #GovernmentPolicy #UAPResearch #FOIARelease? #USA

## 1990, August 4 - Calvine UFO Incident: Diamond-Shaped Object Photographed in Scottish Highlands #CivilianSightings #PhotoEvidence #MultipleWitness #MilitaryUAP #FOIARelease #LeaksDeclass #Europe #UnitedKingdom #Scotland #Calvine

Two hikers near Calvine, Scotland witnessed a large diamond-shaped object hovering silently in the sky before accelerating away at high speed. They captured several photographs using a 35mm camera showing a solid object with a bright or misty appearance. The photos were handed to the UK Ministry of Defence for analysis and disappeared for decades. In 2021, one original photograph was released under the Freedom of Information Act, showing the diamond-shaped object with what appeared to be a military jet nearby for scale. The MOD suggested it may have been a misidentified Harrier jump jet or optical illusion, but no firm conclusion was reached. The case remains one of the UK's most compelling UFO incidents due to photographic evidence, remote location, and official MOD involvement. Only one of the original photographs has been publicly released; the identities of the hikers have never been confirmed.

On February 4, 1977, a yellow cigar-shaped craft was claimed to have landed in a field next to Broadhaven Primary School in Broad Haven, Pembrokeshire, Wales. A group of 14 children claimed to have observed the craft and a silver creature. The headmaster, believing this to be a practical joke, made each child independently draw what they had seen. The resulting pictures were all nearly identical, showing the same cigar-shaped object. This incident is similar to the 1994 Ariel School Incident in Zimbabwe. The entire Pembrokeshire area was inundated with UFO sightings, cryptid reports, and Men in Black encounters throughout 1977, making it one of the UK's most concentrated UFO flaps in UK history.

## 1968, April 2 - Our Lady of Zeitoun: Marian Apparitions Above Coptic Church in Egypt #ReligiousCultural #CivilianSightings #MultipleWitness #PhotoEvidence #HistoricalPreModern #Africa

First reported on April 2, 1968, luminous apparitions interpreted as the Virgin Mary appeared above the Coptic Orthodox Church of Saint Mary in Zeitoun, Cairo, Egypt. The phenomena continued intermittently until 1971 and were witnessed by thousands of people, including Coptic Orthodox and Catholic Christians, Muslims, Jews, foreign diplomats, journalists, skeptics, and scientists. Witnesses reported seeing a luminous female figure, sometimes accompanied by lights in the shape of doves, intense flashes, or glowing halos moving over the church. The Coptic Orthodox Church officially recognized the apparitions on May 4, 1968, under Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria. Estimates suggest 250,000 to millions witnessed the events over three years. The case remains one of the most documented mass sighting events of the 20th century, with photographic evidence and cross-religious witness testimony.

## 1959, December 1 - Antarctic Treaty Signed #LegislationPolicy #International #Antarctica

The Antarctic Treaty was signed in Washington on December 1, 1959, by twelve countries and entered into force on June 23, 1961. The treaty establishes Antarctica as a scientific preserve, prohibits military activity on the continent, and bans nuclear explosions and disposal of radioactive waste. The treaty designates Antarctica as a zone free of nuclear tests and the disposal of radioactive waste, and ensures that the continent is used exclusively for peaceful purposes. Article I prohibits any measures of a military nature, including the establishment of military bases and fortifications, military maneuvers, and weapons testing. The treaty has been signed by 54 nations representing about two-thirds of the world's population. Some researchers have speculated that the treaty's strict regulations may serve to protect sensitive sites or discoveries, though official documentation emphasizes scientific cooperation and environmental protection.

## 1969, December 17 - Project Blue Book Terminated Following Condon Report #GovernmentProgram #ScientificStudy #LegislationPolicy #HistoricalPreModern #USA

The United States Air Force officially terminated Project Blue Book on December 17, 1969, following the conclusions of the Condon Report (Scientific Study of Unidentified Flying Objects) released in January 1969. The Condon Committee, led by physicist Edward Condon at the University of Colorado, concluded that further study of UFOs could not be justified on scientific grounds. The report stated that "nothing has come from the study of UFOs in the past 21 years that has added to scientific knowledge" and recommended discontinuation of Air Force UFO investigations. This decision established the institutional posture toward UAP that persisted for decades, with official government interest appearing to cease until the 2000s. The Condon Report has been criticized for potential bias, with some committee members alleging the conclusion was predetermined. Project Blue Book investigated 12,618 UFO reports from 1952-1969, with 701 cases remaining "unidentified."

**Event Type**: Program_Termination, Scientific_Report, Policy_Decision
**Credibility**: 5/5 (Official Air Force program, peer-reviewed study, government records)
**Related Events**: Ends Project Blue Book (1952-1969); influences decades of official UAP policy; cited in later congressional discussions
**Causal Impact**: Established 50+ year institutional skepticism; created information vacuum filled by civilian researchers; contributed to stigma around UAP reporting

## 1952, March 25 - Project Blue Book Established by US Air Force #GovernmentProgram #MilitaryInvestigation #HistoricalPreModern #USA

The United States Air Force established Project Blue Book on March 25, 1952, as the third and most extensive official U.S. government investigation into unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The program succeeded Projects Sign (1947-1949) and Grudge (1949-1952). Headquartered at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, Project Blue Book was tasked with determining if UFOs posed a threat to national security and to scientifically analyze UFO-related data. The project was directed by several officers over its 17-year span, most notably Captain Edward J. Ruppelt (1952-1953) who coined the term "UFO" to replace "flying saucer." Project Blue Book investigated 12,618 UFO sightings before its termination in 1969, classifying cases as "identified" (known objects/phenomena), "insufficient information," or "unidentified" (701 cases, 5.6% of total). The program's methods and conclusions have been debated, with critics alleging cases were dismissed without proper investigation to reduce public concern.

**Event Type**: Program_Creation, Military_Investigation
**Credibility**: 5/5 (Official Air Force program, extensive documentation, declassified records)
**Related Events**: Succeeds Project Sign and Project Grudge; terminated 1969 following Condon Report; influences modern AATIP/AARO programs
**Causal Impact**: Established first systematic government UAP investigation framework; created classification and analysis protocols; generated extensive case files used by later researchers

## 1955 - Operation Deep Freeze Begins #MilitaryEncounters #Antarctica #USA

Operation Deep Freeze, the codename for a series of United States missions to Antarctica, began in 1955 and continues to the present day. Initially established to support the International Geophysical Year (1957-1958), the operation provides military logistical support for the National Science Foundation's United States Antarctic Program. The operation maintains year-round research stations and conducts extensive scientific research across the continent. The continuous military presence and classified aspects of certain operations have led to speculation about undisclosed activities in Antarctica. Operation Deep Freeze has been instrumental in establishing and maintaining U.S. research facilities including McMurdo Station, Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, and Palmer Station.

**Details:**

Battelle is highlighted as a significant organization involved in various sectors, including defense and science. The post also notes its connections to government agencies, its status as a 501(c)(3) organization, and its control over various national laboratories. The analysis further points out connections between the report's findings and the characteristics of the Roswell crash metal, including its "shape memory" properties. General Arthur Exon's testimony and General George Schulgen's memo, along with other military studies on memory metals, are discussed as supportive evidence.
Dr. Howard C. Cross, a Battelle scientist, is identified as a key figure in UFO research for government agencies and top-secret Titanium alloy studies. The possibility of Battelle's advanced arc furnace's role in creating Nitinol memory metal is raised. The post also delves into Dr. Edgar Mitchell's statements about a "semi or quasi-private organization" involved in UFO secrecy, which the author connects to Battelle due to its characteristics and involvement in UFO-related projects. Overall, the post presents a detailed analysis of documents, reports, and statements to establish the connection between Battelle Memorial Institute and its role in analyzing materials from the Roswell UFO crash.

3\. 50 years later they said that they lied to the public and that it was Mogul balloon, except that according to official documentation and testimony of Albert Crary flight no. 4 allegely responsible for Roswell incident was never launched with full equipment. 
4\. They also lied that eyewitnesses confused crashed test dummies with alien bodies, except that those dummies were used for the first time in 1950s.
5\. Dozens eyewitnesses who saw craft and pieces - Jesse Marcel, Jesse Marcel Jr, Walter Haut, Lewis Rickett, Robert Shirkey, Robert Smith, Bill Brazel Jr, George Wilcox, Frankie Rowe, Robert Slasher, Robert Porter, Edwin Easley, Steven Lovekin, June Crain, Loretta Proctor, Dean Proctor, Rolland Menagh, Richard Talbert, Earl Fulford. Most of them wrote affidavits about it.
6\. There are firsthand eyewitnesses to the bodies - Walter Haut, Eleazar Benevidez, Frederick Benthal, Philip Corso, Patrick Saunders. 
7\. People who admit to cover up - Arthur Exon, Thomas DuBose, Walter Haut, Chase Brandon.
It boggles my mind how most people never heard of any of that and instead they just accept lies and misleading statements that apparently there were only second hand stories and that everything was explained.

## 1947, February - Operation Highjump Concludes Early #MilitaryEncounters #HistoricalPreModern #Antarctica #USA

Operation Highjump, officially designated as the United States Navy Antarctic Developments Program, was a large-scale Antarctic expedition led by Admiral Richard E. Byrd. Launched in August 1946, the operation involved 4,700 personnel, 13 ships, and 33 aircraft, making it the largest Antarctic expedition to date. The mission was scheduled to last 6-8 months but was abruptly terminated in February 1947 after only 8 weeks of operations. Official explanations cited weather conditions and equipment failures, but the sudden termination sparked decades of speculation. The expedition included three task forces conducting extensive aerial photography and mapping, and established Little America IV base. Several aircraft were lost during the operation, officially attributed to harsh weather conditions. The expedition's early termination and subsequent secrecy surrounding certain aspects of the mission have made it a subject of ongoing interest in UAP research communities.

## 1947, March - Admiral Byrd Post-Expedition Statements #WhistleblowerDisclosures #MilitaryEncounters #HistoricalPreModern #Antarctica #USA

Following the early termination of Operation Highjump in February 1947, Admiral Richard E. Byrd allegedly made statements during press conferences and interviews warning about potential threats from polar regions. According to various accounts, Byrd stated that the United States should prepare for the possibility of aircraft that "can fly from pole to pole at incredible speeds." While the exact wording and context of these statements remain disputed, they have become central to speculation about what was encountered during the Antarctic expedition. Official records indicate Byrd continued to advocate for Antarctic research and exploration throughout his career, though specific details about Operation Highjump's early termination remained classified for decades.

## 1947, March 25 - Navy Secretary Forrestal Begins Recruiting "Outstanding Administrators" #MilitaryPrograms #ClassifiedRecords #GovernmentPolicy #LeaksDeclass #Navy #HistoricalPreModern #USA

Three months before Roswell, Navy Secretary James Forrestal drafted a confidential form letter to Naval District Commanders requesting names of "outstanding administrators"—men between 30 and 50, proven, discreet, successful in business, and financially independent enough to accept temporary government service. Political affiliation was explicitly irrelevant. The individuals themselves were not to be informed their names were being submitted. Forrestal specified approximately fifteen candidates as a practical buffer, creating a small personal bench outside normal chains of visibility. Over six days, Forrestal revised the letter twice (March 27 and March 31), finalizing it as standing policy by month's end. A classified Army Air Forces memo dated September 22, 1947 by Lt. Col. Tucker retrospectively references two incidents involving "loaned S-Aircraft" on March 25, 1947 and July 4, 1947, focusing on decompression, radiation exposure, pilot fatalities, and instrumentation limits. The documents reflect different parts of the defense establishment independently adapting structures to manage experimental aircraft whose performance envelopes and physiological effects were not fully understood.

## 1944,  December 14 - New York Times: US Army Air Force reported they were encountering "silver colored spheres" in the air over German territory. The spheres are encountered either singly or in clusters, sometimes translucent #USA

He w...

**Details:**

The American papers, we believe, notice only the extraordinary appearance of the Sun on the above mentioned days. Perhaps the observers on that continent were not in a position to catch the precise appearance which the particles of matter presented to the ship’s company of the Majestic.
There could be no optical delusion on the occasion, as the phenomenon was observed by so many different eyes, and for so long a time. The first figure was seen during the whole of the 27th, the skeleton the whole of the 28th, and the six flags during a great part of the 29th.
The above is an occurrence that may merit the attention of the philosophic. It is singular, we conceive, but nothing miraculous or portentous. Indeed, as the sun is the centre of a system of planets, several of which are much larger and probably more important than ours, we do not know why the common luminary should shape his face, or have it shaped for him, so as to indicate the particular occurrences on this earth.
The sun is, no doubt, a material luminous body—perhaps liable to an internal irregular motion of tis parts; at least, this phenomenon would seem to prove it so; and most people have observed how frequently the ignited cinders of a common fire present, at different times, the various appearances of men, trees, horses, houses &c.,
The evidence, however, for the phenomenon itself, we must again add, is of the most undoubted and respectable kind. We have seen, and have by us, copies of drawings made by Captain Hayes on the occasion.
On December 13th, at Supreme Headquarters, Allied Expeditionary Force, a startling revelation emerged regarding a novel German weapon on the western air front. American Air Force pilots reported their encounters with enigmatic silver spheres hovering over German territory. These spheres appeared either as solitary orbs or in mysterious clusters, occasionally displaying a semi-translucent quality. This astonishing development, dubbed a "secret" weapon, coincided curiously with the Christmas season, resembling the festive glass balls adorning Christmas trees. However, the true nature of these enigmatic spheres remained uncertain, as there was no available information regarding how they remained suspended in the sky, what they contained, or the purpose they were intended to serve. The floating mystery ball had become a perplexing and mystifying addition to the unfolding wartime narrative.
