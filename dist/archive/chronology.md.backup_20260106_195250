## 2025, January 18 - Jake Barber and the egg NHI

Jake Barber’s UAP Testimony. Who is Jake Barber, and why is his background so important?

Answer: Jake Barber is a U.S. Air Force veteran who began his service as an aerospace mechanic in the late 1990s. He later moved into Air Force Special Operations (combat control) after 9/11. His background includes:

A NATO Top Secret clearance, related to his participation in classified missions in Bosnia (where he received an award for heroism). Training in helicopter piloting, freefall parachuting, and special operations tactics.

After leaving active duty, he states that he contracted with the Department of Defense on sensitive retrieval operations, including missions involving UAP (Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena). His military background and subsequent work on classified operations serve as part of the support for his testimony. What are Barber’s primary claims regarding UAP crash retrievals? Answer: Barber claims that he and select helicopter teams conducted retrieval missions of anomalous objects that: Showed no visible propulsion or seams (for example, a white "egg" craft described as approximately 20 feet long and a separate "eight-gon" shaped disc). Appeared to materialize from unusual locations (such as near mountain ridges or emerging from underground). Were moved under high levels of secrecy to secure facilities; his responsibility ended after delivering the object to another team. Details include: Transport Method: Retrieval was performed using helicopters with long sling lines (approximately 150 to 200 feet) to minimize the effects of rotor wash. High Security: Mission briefings included instructions on using lethal force if adversaries attempted to seize the retrieved material. Limited Information on Final Handling: Barber did not receive further details on what happened to the objects after delivery.

Key Takeaways from November 13 2024 Hearings:

\

\* Certain unnamed individuals did not want this hearing to happen, fearing what may be disclosed, says Rep Nancy Mace

\* Mace says there has been an outright refusal to share classified information or cooperate by certain agencies with Congress

\* Mace says AARO is struggling and unable or unwilling to bring forward the truth regarding UAP

\* Mace says if there is "no there there" - then why are we spending money on it, and why can't we see how much money we are spending on it (citing AARO budget as example)

\* Mace says program uncovered which may have been illegally kept from Congressional oversight

\* 12-page report from Shellenberger on Immaculate Constellation collection program entered into record, passed around to members

\* Garcia says this is about "the truth, the science, and facts".

\* Grothman particularly concerned about Langley airspace incursions, cites radar readings

\* Grothman says "we cannot shy away from the unknown especially when the stakes are so high".

\* Moskowitz says "some of us (panel members) were told not to ask you (witnesses) certain questions".

\* Gallaudet says he has seen imagery of disk-shaped object that is classified, can't talk about agency which has it unless in classified setting

\* Elizondo says he has NDA which restricts discussing crash retrievals - provided from the US Govt specifically DOD

\* Elizondo says US has craft retrieval programs and reverse engineering programs

\* Elizondo says US Govt is paying veterans for injuries sustained due to UAP related injuries but Pentagon denies existence of UAP

\* Shellenberger says US military industrial complex sitting on a mountain of data and information relating to UAP, high-resolution, potentially thousands of files - says some of the source collection that is classified is shot from helicopters using unclassified collection platforms

\* Gallaudet says congress should have all information related to the tic-tac incident, speculates that Pentagon doesn't want to share data because it shows weaknesses in our defenses

\* Gallaudet says AARO tried to convince him verified UAP reports weren't actually UAP (that they were American technology), they questioned him, and tried to tell him other whistleblowers weren't credible

\* Elizondo says enough data to suggest relationship between sensitive US military / nuclear installations and heavy UAP activity - going back decades

\* Elizondo says he agrees with Grusch - UAP programs operating without congressional oversight.

\* "Career Psychological operations officer" as the main point of contact at the Pentagon for all things UAP, individual also worked with previous AARO leadership (Kirkpatrick)

\* Gallaudet speculates author (superior) of email was silenced and an intel agency was involved (cites "spillage"

\* Gallaudet says a USO in the 80's exhibited characteristics of Russian torpedo, but approached nuclear submarine then slowed, followed for a few minutes, then rapidly exited the scene

\* Gallaudet and Elizondo says AARO and DOD involved in misinformation campaigns against whistleblowers

\* Shellenberger says author of Immaculate Constellation report is either a current or former government official - and doesn't know where the "unofficial" report on Immaculate Constellation might be

\* Elizondo says craft shaped could be origin-related but could also be a "matter of utility"

\* Greene notes that there must be a great deal of research and study behind report to be able to know how injuries from certain types of craft experiences differ from others - Shellenberger confirms huge database, says that a single-source told him USAP managed within DOD somewhere but "held" at the White House (I speculate, via NSC?)

\* Gallaudet says USOs have outpaced US submarines by orders of magnitude

\* Elizondo says UAP are intelligently controlled as in certain military cases UAP anticipate human maneuvers and also "stalk" US Navy ships

\* Elizondo says UAP have been recorded moving in excess of 2000 - 3000 Gs.

\* Luna speculates there are "good and bad" of whatever they are and posits how does that tie into religion, religious individuals who have experiences. No one answers.

\* All witnesses agree that aspects of the federal government are knowingly concealing information on UAPs from the general public.

\* "Non-Human, Higher Intelligence" is personal conclusion on majority of UAP reports from Gallaudet and Elizondo.

\* Biggs questions for what reason the government is over-classifying UAP information; Elizondo touts cold war, adversaries, philosophical narratives on national defense. Biggs says "it's too painful for them to admit".

\* Gold says "all breakthroughs are heretical"

\* Elizondo says Lockheed (didn't mention contractor name, but we know this via other sources) had craft material from 1950s and tried to divest to USAP, but this divestiture was blocked, Air Force nor SecDef never provided memo necessary - Elizondo can't comment on where those materials are today, says it's up to the gatekeepers still within the US Govt

\* Elizondo says we have biological samples but those particular biological samples were collected before he was born, and that those biologics are "separate but related" to aforementioned craft materials allegedly held by Lockheed

\* Elizondo agrees that UAP incursions are becoming more and more "brash" and "provocative". Discusses heightened awareness by military assets, better sensor capabilities for recording and analysis.

\* Timmons speculates that it's either China or Non-Human, "China has technology we don't understand, and if it's non-human, we don't know intent".

\* Elizondo can't answer whether there are any technologies of non-human origin tied in with "advanced bio-science defense programs within the USG"

\* None of the witnesses mention being familiar with non-human genetic / hybridization programs.

\* Shellenberger says information on USOs being withheld from other areas of government, discusses orbs entering and exiting ocean

\* Elizondo says US has foreign material programs when asked if we share information on UAP with international partners

\* Regarding materials given to US Contractors, example of General Dynamics for underwater propulsion, Lockheed Martin for aerospace - but Elizondon says "no, I didn't say Lockheed doesn't do submerged" - gets flustered, says Lockheed Martin can explain which domains they are involved in

\* Gold says we are looking for intelligence that might be biological, but we need to be prepared that it might not be. Discusses technological life, artificial intelligence, machine learning.

\* Ogles mentions Oak Ridge UAP incident. Elizondo speculates on military site interest - Savannah River, Los Alamos, a lot of sensitive R&D sites have had UAP incursions. This is where our most advanced scientific concepts originate. Sees this as a form of reconnaissance on adversarial capability.

\* Gallaudet says cover-up is unconstitutional (in fewer words) and infringes on congressional oversight - "greatest issue of our time is being hid from you (congress)".

\* Ogles says "it is clear from your experiences, and from what I have seen, that there is something out there".

## 2024, July 14 - UAP 2.0 text is released. Eminent domain and review board are back. Amendment Text: S.Amdt.2610 — 118th Congress (2023-2024)

The Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Disclosure Act of 2024, or UAP Disclosure Act of 2024, aims to manage and disclose records related to unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP). The Act emphasizes the preservation and centralized disclosure of all Federal Government records on UAPs, highlighting the inadequacy of the Freedom of Information Act for timely public release. It mandates the creation of a UAP Records Collection within the National Archives, ensuring both physical and digital availability, and prohibits the destruction or alteration of these records. Grounds for postponing public disclosure include threats to military defence, intelligence operations, or foreign relations. An independent Review Board, appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, will oversee the transmission and disclosure of UAP records and can subpoena information. The Act also stipulates that the Federal Government shall exercise eminent domain over recovered technologies of unknown origin and biological evidence of non-human intelligence. Definitions provided in the Act include terms such as "Archivist," "Close observer," "Executive agency," "Non-human intelligence," and "Unidentified anomalous phenomena." The Act authorizes $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2025 to implement its provisions and ensures that, even after the Review Board ceases, the process of making all UAP records public will continue.

## 2024, May 30 - A UK Freedom of Information request has revealed the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) is currently researching how it will react to the so-called ‘black swan’ event that is discovering extraterrestrial life, including announcing the find to the public.

A black swan event is unpredictable and has wide-ranging consequences, but in hindsight, it appears to have been inevitable.

The report is investigating whether a plan already exists – none has ever been made public – what a plan would look like, and how the UK can be ‘on the front foot’ should such an astounding scientific discovery finally be made. It has been conducted for over six months and will be finalised in July, at which point a new government could receive it. An internal report will be presented to the DSIT Permanent Secretary setting out recommendations for an action plan including opportunities, challenges and areas of expertise. While a summary of the work states the primary focus of the report will be ‘the impact on the science landscape’, it will also consider the wider impact.

Today, at a U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Accountability hearing, Representative Anna Paulina Luna asked Department of Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm about a specific UAP incursion that occurred at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory on April 30th, 2019, in which metallic spheres were seen flying around. Video timestamped to when Luna asked this question: At approximately 10:30 AM, I was notified by the Central Alarm Station (CAS) about a possible drone sighting. The CAS Operator mentioned hearing escorts at the building 815 project discussing a drone in their vicinity at approximately 10:27 AM. I contacted the Security Escorts at building 815 in the Process Area. They both reported seeing a round silver drone flying around the Process Area. It would periodically stop and hover for several seconds, then continue flying. It headed north of their location, stopped and hovered again for several more seconds. The drone was reportedly in their area for several minutes before departing towards the southeast. The drone was flying at such a height and distance that its specific characteristics were impossible to identify. I contacted another individual who confirmed that no drone flights were scheduled for Site 300 that day. A team member was dispatched to sweep Corral Hollow Road, but no personnel were found in the area. Another team member drove to the area around building 836 and reported that it was clear. I continued to monitor the Process Area but did not spot the drone again. At 10:40 AM, the incident was reported to the relevant authorities. Further notifications were made to other team members.

## 2024, May 21 - "Non-human intelligence exists. Non-human intelligence has been interacting with humanity. This interaction is not new and has been ongoing." - Karl Nell, retired Army Colonel.

Alex Klokus interviewed Colonel Karl Nell at SALT iConnections New York, where Knell discussed evidence of non-human intelligence on earth. He detailed the U.S. government's level of knowledge and its disclosure process. Knell says there's zero doubt non-human intelligent life has visited Earth and dives deep into what exactly that means for humans. Karl Nell is an active Pentagon official four (4) steps removed from the United States president. Currently works as an advisor to the Vice Chief of Staff in the Army Futures Command. The unit was only relatively recently created in 2018 and works with experimental prototypes for future combat systems. Col. Karl E. Nell is predicting that an updated version of the UAP Disclosure Act will be reintroduced in Congress this summer, with a goal of adding it to the NDAA by the end of the year. At his presentation at SALT, Col. Karl Nell specifically namedropped Paul Hellyer (former Minister of National Defence of Canada) and Haim Eshed (former Director of Space Programs for Israeli Ministry of Defense) as people in positions to know that should be taken seriously: Nell goes on to lay out the reasons the government is actively concealing knowledge of NHI from the public, it's mostly societal implications, he calls the government "reactionary" instead of "proactive" because they're unwilling to accept the reality of higher lifeforms interacting with us and aren't ready to create a coherent plan for the future of that reality.

Additionally, Rear Admiral Tim Gallaudet corroborates Karl Nell's statement on LinkedIn: "My colleague, retired Army Colonel Karl Nell, said with 100% certainty that the world is being visited by higher-level, non-human intelligence (NHI). I know he is correct with complete certainty." Nell told the world to look to a Canadian minister of defence and the founder of Israel's space program.

### Key takeaways

1. The speaker, Karl Nell, believes that non-human intelligence exists and has been interacting with humanity. This is not a new phenomenon, and there are people within the government who are aware of it. 

1. Evidence for this belief comes from key figures with high-level access to information, such as Paul Hellyer, Ham Eshed, Chris Mellon, Lou Elizondo, and David Grush. All of them have stated similar beliefs regarding the existence of non-human intelligence.

1. The government has not officially disclosed this information for six main reasons: national security, lack of a plan, potential societal disruption, potential non-public agreements, potential misdeeds and cover-ups, and basic organizational intransigence. 

1. Despite these reasons, Karl Nell believes that disclosure should still occur for three reasons: people have a moral right to know, being proactive is better than being reactive, and societal advancement and global competitiveness could benefit from more people being aware of this topic.

1. Karl Nell warns of the possibility of "catastrophic disclosure," where the truth is forced out in a way that could cause societal upheaval. He suggests that the world could be in a state similar to the collapse of the Bronze Age, where civilizations failed due to stressors they couldn't handle.

1. The intentions of non-human intelligence are unknown. Karl Nell suggests that their intentions might be driven by the same Darwinian evolutionary process that governs life on Earth, making it naive to expect either complete altruism or malintent.

1. Karl Nell suggests that disclosure is not inevitable, given that previous cycles of interest in disclosure have come and gone. However, he hopes that recent legislative efforts, such as the Schumer Amendment, could lead to more progress in this area.

1. The phenomenon of non-human intelligence is a global issue, not just a U.S. issue. Therefore, it would be beneficial for nations to work collectively on this.

1. Karl Nell believes that humanity can pursue an understanding of the ultimate truth, which includes understanding non-human intelligence. This pursuit is part of our existence.

1. The speaker also indicates that there might be a race to reverse-engineer alien technology, as it could provide a strategic advantage to the nation that accomplishes it first. However, he also acknowledges the potential instability that could come with such a transition.

## 2024, May 19 - the Vatican releases new norms on alleged supernatural phenomena

The Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith released a document detailing new norms regarding reported supernatural phenomena. Neither the local bishop nor the Holy See declares that these phenomena are of supernatural origin; instead, they authorize and promote devotion and pilgrimages.

## 2024, May 17—The deadline for copies is Sept. 30, the end of the federal fiscal year. Agencies have until Oct. 24 to review, identify, and organize their material.

The UAP Records Collection will consist of “copies of all Government, Government-provided, or Government-funded records relating to unidentified anomalous phenomena, technologies of unknown origin, and non-human intelligence” The 2024 National Defense Authorization Act (Public Law 118-31, Sections 1841-1843) requires NARA to establish the ‘‘Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Records Collection.” The law requires that by October 20, 2024, each federal agency review, identify, and organize each Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) record in its custody for disclosure to the public and transmission to the National Archives.  The Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) Records Collection will consist of  “copies of all Government, Government-provided, or Government-funded records relating to unidentified anomalous phenomena, technologies of unknown origin, and non-human intelligence (or equivalent subjects by any other name with the specific and sole exclusion of temporarily non-attributed objects).”  

Agencies must identify all UAP records in any format, make digital copies of these records, and prepare them for transfer to NARA by the deadline established by the act. NARA will only accept the digital versions of UAP records. Publicly releasable copies of UAP records transferred to NARA will be made available online in the National Archives Catalog. NARA will provide an online finding aid that will be integrated with the Catalog. Agencies will continue to manage the source records in their custody according to the NARA-approved disposition schedule. Temporary records will eventually be destroyed. Permanent records will eventually be transferred to NARA, even if a copy has already been transmitted as part of the UAP collection.

## 2023, April 17 - Tim Gallaudet, an oceanographer and former Naval rear admiral who served as the author of a March white paper about so-called "unidentified submerged objects" or USOs, told Fox News this week that he considers it both "scientifically valid" and critical to national security to study these phenomena.

Released by the newly-convened Sol Foundation, a think tank dedicated to studying what the military calls "unidentified anomalous phenomena" (UAPs), the 29-page report centers on a 2019 video taken aboard the Omaha off the coast of San Diego. The video, which was leaked to filmmaker Jeremy Corbell and verified by the Pentagon as a legit instance of Naval-recorded UAP in 2021, raises more questions than it answers — and in both his interview and the Sol Foundation report, Gallaudet suggests that the strange craft should be treated as a threat.

- Extraterrestrial - originating, existing, or occurring outside the Earth or its atmosphere

- AARO found no evidence that any USG investigation, academic-sponsored research, or official review panel has confirmed that any sighting of a UAP represented extraterrestrial technology

    - Correct, there are no claims or evidence for extraterrestrial technology.

- AARO found no empirical evidence to support claims that the USG and private companies have reverse-engineered extraterrestrial technology. Based on all information provided to date, AARO determined that claims involving specific people, known locations, technological tests, and documents allegedly involved in or related to this activity are inaccurate. Additional claims will be addressed in Volume II. 

    - Correct, there are no claims of reverse engineering for extraterrestrial technology.

- AARO assesses that all of the named and described alleged hidden UAP reverse-engineering programs provided by interviewees either do not exist, are misidentified authentic, highly sensitive national security programs that are not related to extraterrestrial technology exploitation, or resolve to an unwarranted and disestablished program

    - Again, careful use of extraterrestrial term

- AARO assesses that the inaccurate claim that the USG is reverse-engineering extraterrestrial technology and is hiding it from Congress is, in large part, the result of circular reporting from a group of individuals who believe this to be the case, despite the lack of any evidence.

    - Again, careful use of extraterrestrial term

- AARO assesses that UAP sightings, reports of these sightings to USG organizations, and claims that some UAP constitute extraterrestrial craft and that the USG has secured and is experimenting with extraterrestrial technology have been influenced by a range of cultural, political, and technological factors.

    - Again, careful use of extraterrestrial term

- Several factors—domestic and international—most likely influenced sightings, reports, and some individuals' belief that there is sufficient proof that some UAP represent extraterrestrial technology.

    - Again, careful use of extraterrestrial terms and the word "some."

- AARO assesses that some portion of sightings since the 1940s have represented misidentification of never-before-seen experimental and operational space, rocket, and air systems, including stealth technologies and the proliferation of drone platforms

    - Again, the use of the word "some."

## 2024, January 12 - Congress interviews the DoD ICIG in a SCIF

- Rep. Mace: “Grusch \[was\] determined to be credible in some of the things that we discussed today. Private contractors should be on that witness list. I won’t name names, but we have a better sense of who that might be. This is not going away."

- Burchett and Graves with Cuomo tidbits: There was a "big deal" in the SCIF, and AOC was present

- “They were told of specific facilities by the ICIG. They will now try to gain access or door-knock.”

- Rep. Luna: “Grusch never said ‘extraterrestrial,’ he said ‘interdimensional.’ There is a movement to prevent us from finding out more information.”

- Rep. Jared Moskowitz: "Based on what we heard, many of Grusch's claims have merit!"

- Tim Burchett confirms after hearing, "Grusch is legit."

- Garcia with NewsNation After the Scif Interview: This is a serious issue, new information received today

- Burchett: "Pretty definitive answers...made what I think more credible."

- Robert Garcia appears shaken by what was discussed and says there was substantial info shared with the committee.

### Background

According to Grusch (and many other sources), the Atomic Energy Act was used to classify UAP back in the day. They used this legal definition to shove UAPs in there conveniently:

Such material is capable of releasing substantial quantities of atomic energy. The president can't legally declassify or disclose anything that falls under that act:

[https://www.americanbar.org/news/abanews/aba-news-archives/2022/10/fact-check-presidential-authority/](https://www.americanbar.org/news/abanews/aba-news-archives/2022/10/fact-check-presidential-authority/)

Some secrets, such as information related to nuclear weapons, are handled separately under a specific statutory scheme that Congress has adopted under the Atomic Energy Act. The president cannot automatically declassify those secrets alone and must, by law, consult extensively with executive branch agencies.

This is why Schumer's UAPDA was required to give the president that legal right. The UAPDA even called out The Atomic Energy Act as an obstacle (Before they gutted it)

Legislation is necessary because credible evidence and testimony indicate that Federal Government unidentified anomalous phenomena records exist that have not been declassified or subject to mandatory declassification review as set forth in Executive Order 13526 (50 U.S.C. 3161 note; relating to classified national security information) due in part to exemptions under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.) It also includes an over-broad interpretation of ‘‘trans-classified foreign nuclear information,’’ which is also exempt from mandatory declassification, thereby preventing public disclosure under existing provisions of law.

### Timeline

The archivist preps the ID form on Day 0 (Dec 22, 2023) and collects uap recs on Day 45 (Feb 5, 2024). On Day 60 (Feb 20, 2024), the Government office preps recs. After Day 300 (Oct 18, 2024), the recs are ready for publication. Inspection at the National Archive begins on Day 330 post-transmit (Nov 17, 2024). On Day 540 (Jun 20, 2025), the records become available online. If postponed, Congress must be notified within 15 days. All records must be published within a maximum of 25 years, and there are limits on unreported SAP programs.

### Summary

- Limitations on Use of Funds for Unreported Programs: No funds can be used to support activities involving unidentified anomalous phenomena unless the Secretary of Defense provides details to the appropriate congressional committees and leadership. This applies to activities described in the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office's 2024 fiscal year report.

- Independent Research and Development: Funding related to unidentified anomalous phenomena cannot be considered as indirect expenses for contracts covered by Department of Defense Instruction Number 3204.01. However, such information can be made available to the appropriate congressional committees and leadership.

- Definitions: Terms such as "appropriate congressional committees," "congressional leadership", and "unidentified anomalous phenomena" are clearly defined.

- Establishment of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Records Collection: The Archivist is to establish a collection of unidentified anomalous phenomena records in the National Archives. The collection will consist of all government, government-provided, or government-funded records relating to unidentified anomalous phenomena and equivalent subjects.

- Disclosure of Records: All unidentified anomalous phenomena records transmitted to the National Archives for public disclosure will be included in the Collection and made available to the public.

- Fees for Copying: The Archivist will charge fees for copying unidentified anomalous phenomena records, with the amount not exceeding the actual expenses incurred by the National Archives in making and providing the copy.

- Review, Identification, Transmission to the National Archives, and Public Disclosure of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Records by Government Offices: Each head of a Government office is to identify, organize, and prepare for transmission records relating to unidentified anomalous phenomena to the Archivist for inclusion in the Collection.

- Grounds for Postponement of Public Disclosure of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Records: Disclosure of these records may be postponed if there is clear and convincing evidence that the threat to the military defense, intelligence operations, or conduct of foreign relations of the United States posed by the public disclosure outweighs the public interest in disclosure.

- Funding Limitations Relating to Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: No funds can be used in support of any activity involving unidentified anomalous phenomena unless the Director of National Intelligence has provided the details of the activity to the appropriate committees of Congress and congressional leadership.

### Timeline

- Enactment of the Act: This is the starting point of the timeline. The specific date will depend on when the Act is officially passed into law.

- Within 45 days of enactment, The Archivist prepares and makes available to all Government offices a standard form of identification for use with each record (Sec. 1842).

- No later than 60 days after enactment: The Archivist commences the establishment of a collection of unidentified anomalous phenomena records at the National Archives (Sec. 1841).

- As soon as practicable after enactment, Each head of a government office begins to identify, organize, and prepare for transmission of the records in their possession (Sec. 1842).

- Not later than 300 days after enactment: Each head of a Government office completes the review, identification, and organization of each record for public disclosure and transmission (Sec. 1842).

- Records are available to the public for inspection and copying at the National Archives within 30 days of their transmission (Sec. 1841).

- Records are available digitally via the National Archives online database within 180 days of their transmission (Sec. 1841).

- If disclosure is postponed, The head of the Executive agency notifies congressional leadership and the oversight committees of Congress within 15 days of such decision (Sec. 1843).

- No later than 25 years after the date of the first creation of the record: Each record shall be publicly disclosed in full (Sec. 1842).

- Fiscal year 2024: Limitations on the use of funds for certain unreported programs involving unidentified anomalous phenomena come into effect (Sec. 1687, Sec. 7343).

### Analysis

See threads and discussions for links to source materials. 

- 😀 Sec. 1005—Requirement for unqualified opinion on Department of Defense financial statement - Requires the DOD to get a clean audit by 2028.

- 😀 Sec. 1687. Limitation on use of funds for certain unreported programs - Gillibrand Amendment - prohibits funds from being used on any UAP programs unless disclosed to Congressional leadership and Intel and Armed Services Committees. This also covers IRADs.

- 🤔 Sec. 1841. Unidentified anomalous phenomena records collection at the National Archives and Records Administration—Parts of Schumer/Rounds—Establishes a collection of records in the National Archives for UAP records. The Senate Homeland Security, Armed Services, and Intel Committees, together with the House Oversight, Armed Services, and Intel Committees, have oversight. 

- 😒 Sec 1842. Sec. 1842. Review, identification, transmission to the National Archives, and public disclosure of unidentified anomalous phenomena records by government offices - More of Schumer/Rounds - Each governmental office holding UAP records must identify all UAP records and send them to the National Archives. There is no review board. However, there is a requirement that each document must be disclosed in full within 25 years of its creation unless the President certifies that there would be identifiable harm to national security and that outweighs the public interest in disclosure.

- 😡 Sec 1843. Grounds for postponement of public disclosure of unidentified anomalous phenomena records - Contains some additional circumstances under which particular records can be withheld from disclosure when they involve grave harm to national security and reveal sources and methods.

- ☹️ There's a lot more to Sections 1841-3, as they are quite complex and will require further analysis in the coming days. They are far short of what we want, but we shouldn't be blind to any benefits contained within them.

- 😀 Section 7343. Funding limitations relating to unidentified anomalous phenomena. - largely a repeat of Section 1687

- 🤔 Sections 7601-6 contain broad reforms to the laws on classification that will require further analysis. It may have an impact on UAP secrecy issues. Previously mentioned it here: https://x.com/CuriousNHI/status/1695792419864813837?s=20

- 🤔 Sec. 7801-4. Improved funding flexibility for payments made by the Central Intelligence Agency for qualifying injuries to the brain contains provisions related to assisting those subject to anomalous health incidents (i.e., possible UAP or Havana syndrome). More analysis is required, but previously covered this here: https://x.com/CuriousNHI/status/1695792420993069266?s=20

- 😤 It also appears that they took out reforms of the IC IG whistleblower process that were in part or wholly inspired by some of the issues David Grusch had.

## 2023, November 29 - National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024. In Congress, passed senate #law   #usadc

[https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/2226](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/2226) 

[https://amendments-rules.house.gov/amendments/BURCTN_024_xml230630091142613.pdf](https://amendments-rules.house.gov/amendments/BURCTN_024_xml230630091142613.pdf) 

21:53:04👾: If the Senate passes the yearly NDAA bill and Congress creates and passes a different version of the bill. how do the two get reconciled? This is the National Defence bill

21:53:04🤖: When the Senate and the House of Representatives (collectively referred to as Congress) each pass different versions of a bill, such as the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), they reconcile the differences through a process known as "conference." In this process, a "conference committee" is formed, made up of members from both the Senate and the House. This committee's job is to resolve discrepancies between the two versions of the bill. They create a "conference report," which is essentially a compromise bill that draws from both the Senate's and House's versions. Once the conference committee agrees on a final version of the bill, it is sent back to both the Senate and the House for a vote. If both pass it, it then goes to the President for approval or veto. If they cannot agree, the bill may die, or one house may decide to pass the other house's version. If the President vetoes the bill, it can still become law if both the Senate and the House vote to override the veto with a two-thirds majority in each chamber.

\

The NDAA is a huge document, with over 2,330 pages. It is divided into hierarchies as such:

Division -> Title -> Subtitle -> Part -> Section

As I understand it, Burchett’s Bill is to be added to the end of Subtitle G, of Title X, of Division A. Namely:

Division A: Department of Defense Authorizations

Title X: General Provisions

Subtitle G: Other Matters

This is the only “Subtitle G” of a “Title A” that I could find in the entire document, so I assume this is the portion of the NDAA that Burchett is referring to.

The existing UAP Disclosure Act has an entire Division dedicated to it, namely:

Division G: Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Disclosure

Based on this understanding of the NDAA, Burchett’s addition to the bill didn't seem intended to replace the Senate UAP Disclosure Act, regardless of what Gaetz’s tweet implied.

\

AMENDMENT TO RULES COMMITTEE PRINT 118- 10 OFFERED BY MR. BURCHETT OF TENNESSEE At the end of subtitle G of title X, add the following new section: 1 SEC. 10ll. DECLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN REPORTS OF 2 UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL PHENOMENA. 3 (a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 180 days after the 4 dates of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense 5 shall declassify any documents and other records in the 6 possession of the Department of Defense relating to pub7 likely known sightings of unidentified aerial phenomena. 8 (b) DEFINITION.—In this section, the term ‘‘publicly 9 known sighting of unidentified aerial phenomena’’ means 10 a sighting of an unidentified aerial phenomenon 11 about which there is information available in the public 12 domain prior to the declassification of documents and 13 records required under subsection (a).

## 2023, November 10 - CIA has 'secret office that has retrieved UFOs from 9 crash sites around world'

In a shocking revelation, it has emerged that the CIA has a secretive office which has been retrieving aircraft from UFO crash sites for decades. Now, politicians are calling for more transparency. At least nine “ non-human craft” have been collected by the US government in top secret operations which have only just been revealed. Some of these UFOs - collected by the Office of Global Access (OGA) wing of the Central Intelligence Agency’s science team - have been destroyed by a crash while two have remained entirely intact.

## 2023, September 14 - NASA is well-positioned to contribute to studying Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) within a broader government framework. The agency's expertise in data analysis, collection, curation, and distribution makes it a key player.

[https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-shares-unidentified-anomalous-phenomena-independent-study-report](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-shares-unidentified-anomalous-phenomena-independent-study-report)

NASA is well-positioned to contribute to studying Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) within a broader government framework. The agency's expertise in data analysis, collection, curation, and distribution makes it a key player. Engaging the public through crowdsourcing techniques, such as smartphone apps, can enhance data collection. NASA should explore the development of a crowdsourcing system and help establish a standardized civilian UAP reporting system. Additionally, NASA's involvement can help reduce the stigma around UAP reporting, which currently hinders data collection. NASA's credibility and transparency can set an example for approaching UAP research scientifically and involving the public. Furthermore, the panel suggests integrating UAP studies into the Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS), administered by NASA for the FAA. This confidential system, receiving thousands of reports yearly, could provide valuable data for understanding UAP threats to airspace safety. Leveraging NASA's partnership with the FAA, advanced analysis techniques could enhance future air traffic management systems. NASA's fleet of earth-observing satellites should play a powerful supporting role in determining the environmental conditions that coincide with UAP. It is essential to note the pivotal role structured data curation plays in a rigorous and evidence-based framework to understand UAP better. The U.S. commercial remote-sensing industry offers a potent mix of Earth-observing sensors with the potential to resolve UAP events directly. The standardization of collected information via well-crafted calibration will make it possible to carry out a rigorous scientific investigation into UAP. NASA's experience in this area will be vital. NASA should leverage its considerable expertise in this domain to potentially utilize multispectral or hyperspectral data as part of a rigorous campaign.

This post discusses the discovery of two previously unknown species with unique genetic information backed up in a DNA database accessible to other scientists for verification. Tests, including those by metallurgy specialists, radiologists, and geneticists, have authenticated the bodies and their age. Scans of the bodies reveal metal implants, eggs with embryos, and organic material inside. It mentions government efforts to block and spread misinformation about these findings. The post also highlights depictions of similar beings in ancient civilizations. The author encourages scepticism and independent research. Forensic scientists discuss scans of substances found on the bodies and speculate on their joints and motor function. DNA comparisons with over a million samples reveal a departure from the Darwinian theory of evolution. The post concludes by asserting the authenticity of these once-living creatures. Jaime Maussan, a self-proclaimed "ufologist" with a history of pseudoscience and false claims about extraterrestrials, presented two specimens allegedly of "alien" remains to the Mexican Congress. Maussan testified that the shrivelled grey bodies with three fingers on each hand are "non-human beings not part of our terrestrial evolution." However, experts quickly criticized his claims, stating that they lacked evidence. Maussan's assertion that carbon dating conducted by researchers at the National Autonomous University of Mexico supports his claims was contradicted by the university, which distanced itself from his testimony. Maussan's previous claims, including one about an alien body in 2015 and another involving specimens in Nazca, Peru, in 2017, have been debunked. Despite the lack of analysis and data release, images of the supposed aliens have circulated on social media. This incident coincides with renewed interest in extraterrestrial phenomena, as NASA appointed its first director of UAP research and former Air Force intelligence officer David Grusch testified about non-human "biologics" from UAP crash sites.

The Mexican Chamber of Deputies is set to conduct a public hearing similar to those held in the United States Congress, focusing on unidentified flying objects (UFOs). Morenista representative Sergio Gutiérez Luna announced this, with renowned UFO specialist Jaime Maussan participating in the event. Gutiérez Luna stated that Mexico is joining the global movement of nations addressing this phenomenon, emphasizing the potential impact on future generations. The hearing will include speakers like former US Navy pilot Ryan Graves, who claims to have encountered UFOs during flights and aims to establish regulations for anomalous aerial phenomena in Mexico. Jaime Maussan welcomed the Mexican authorities' openness to these "extraordinary realities," and the public hearing is scheduled for September 12th at 4:00 p.m. in the San Lázaro campus. Earlier in the US, a subcommittee of the House Oversight conducted a hearing featuring military officers testifying about UFO sightings, confirming the US government's detection of such objects, encompassing phenomena in space or water. The hearing, broadcast live on YouTube, lasted over two hours and involved individuals from the intelligence community reporting encounters with anomalous ships and evidence of "non-human intelligence."

Additionally, retired Major David Grusch revealed to Congress a long-standing US program dedicated to recovering and reverse-engineering UFOs, contradicting the Pentagon's denial of such claims. This congressional involvement in "unidentified aerial phenomena" (UAP) reflects a shift from extraterrestrial speculations to national security concerns, with lawmakers from both parties advocating for further investigation due to potential ties to US adversaries.

## 2023, September 12 - NASA's James Webb Space Telescope may have detected a molecule called dimethyl sulphide (DMS). On Earth, at least, this is only produced by life.

[https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-66786611](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-66786611) 

NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has potentially discovered a molecule called dimethyl sulphide (DMS) on a distant planet, K2-18b, which could indicate life, as living organisms on Earth typically produce DMS. However, researchers emphasize that this finding is not yet confirmed, and more data is needed. In addition to DMS, methane and carbon dioxide have been detected in the planet's atmosphere, potentially indicating the presence of a water ocean. K2-18b is unique as it is much larger than Earth and falls into the category of "sub-Neptunes," poorly understood in terms of their atmospheres. While this discovery is exciting, further research is required to ascertain the presence of life in this distant world.

Starting around the 20:40 mark, the discussion delves into the creation of laws related to obfuscation and secrecy by the officials involved in the Manhattan Project. It's highlighted that UAP materials emitting radiation are intentionally classified under the Atomic Energy Act. Moving to the 23:00 mark, there's mention of a classified project related to the Manhattan Project that studied UFOs independently of Project Blue Book. Skipping to the 28:00 mark, Grusch suggests that gauging the technological advancement of nonhuman intelligence is challenging. He emphasizes that their progress isn't necessarily linear and may have taken a different evolutionary path but are not significantly more advanced than humans. At 29:50, he mentions the potential for humanity to make major technological strides, possibly one discovery away from manipulating spacetime. Around 30:29, it's noted that UFOs appear to be interested in our nuclear technology. Skipping to 36:00, the discussion raises the possibility of hidden scientific breakthroughs. At 44:00, Dr. Hal Puthoff of the Pentagon insinuates that antigravity research made progress and was subsequently hidden. Around 47:00, UFO metamaterials are discussed. The host connects the "UFO Disclosure" movement and intentional disinformation to the "elite." Moving to 1:04:00, there's a history of "UFO debunkers" linked to government organizations studying UAP. At 1:17:28, Elizondo and Dr. Garry Nolan's statements about bioengineered AI beings operating UFOs are referenced. Grusch explores this possibility, including the idea that these beings are designed to look humanoid to interact with humans. Around 1:19:30, the possibility of ETs being our descendants from the future is discussed, with the host suggesting they might avoid major interventions to preserve the timeline. Finally, from 1:27:00 onward, Grusch details how being on the Autism spectrum has influenced his interactions.

The Department of Defense is reshuffling leadership at the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office, the agency within the Pentagon that’s responsible for investigating reports of unidentified aerial phenomena or, as they’re better known, unidentified flying objects. Deputy Secretary Of Defense Kathleen Hicks will now oversee AARO, while the program’s current director, Sean Kirkpatrick, will report directly to her.

AARO will accept reports from current or former U.S. Government employees, service members, or contractors with direct knowledge of U.S. Government programs or activities related to UAP dating back to 1945\*.  These reports will inform AARO’s congressionally directed Historical Record Report.  We will announce when a reporting mechanism is available for others to use. The Pentagon on Thursday announced the launch of a new website with the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), which will provide the public with declassified information about UFOs, or what the government calls unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs). Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks recently moved to personally oversee the Pentagon’s unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) investigation team, formally known as the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, DefenseScoop has exclusively learned. A new website will soon be launched where incidents can be reported.

Hicks now holds regular meetings with AARP's inaugural director, Sean Kirkpatrick — who she’s also repositioned to report directly to her.

 The origins of this release remain a mystery. There are two main possibilities: either CBP took the initiative to proactively disclose these materials to the public, or they were released as a result of a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. The Black Vault currently has multiple FOIA cases with CBP. Some of these requests were transferred to other agencies, while others remain open with CBP.

In a letter to Inspector General Thomas A. Monheim, dated \[Date\], the House Oversight and Accountability Subcommittee on National Security, the Border, and Foreign Affairs discusses a recent hearing on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs). During this hearing, Mr. David Grusch, an Air Force veteran and former intelligence officer, declined to answer certain questions in a public setting due to the classified nature of the information. Mr. Grusch indicated he could provide the requested information regarding individuals with knowledge of UAP crash retrieval and reverse engineering programs to the Intelligence Community Inspector General's office. The Subcommittee, considering Mr. Grusch's sworn testimony, requests information from the Inspector General on the following points: details about intelligence community members, positions, facilities, military bases, or other relevant actors involved in UAP crash retrieval programs, either directly or indirectly, and information regarding intelligence community members, positions, facilities, military bases, or other relevant actors involved in UAP reverse engineering programs, either directly or indirectly. The letter sets a deadline of September 15, 2023, for responding to these questions. If the requested information contains classified material, the Subcommittee also requests access to this information within a secure setting by September 26, 2023. The purpose of the letter is to seek clarification and insight into the individuals and entities connected to UAP-related programs within the intelligence community.

David Grusch's testimony received the most attention with his statement: "I have no ability to verify that testimony because we’ve not been told of any such programs. We’ve asked for all information related to all programs and have not been given that detail." As someone who helped secure full funding for AARO this year, do you believe the U.S. adequately researches and reviews incidents of unidentified anomalous phenomena? I believe that the AARO office is exceptional and well-equipped for this task. If there are any special access programs – SAP programs – that Congress has not been informed about, we have included an amendment in the defence bill to prevent their funding. We aim to avoid being misled or led astray. We are committed to uncovering the truth, and this office is ideally positioned to accomplish that mission.

Ryan Graves, the Executive Director of Americans for Safe Aerospace, emphasizes the regularity and seriousness of UFO sightings in restricted airspace off the Atlantic Coast. He stresses the need for serious investigation and acknowledgement of potential threats posed by these unidentified objects. Commander David Fravor, a former U.S. Navy pilot, recounts a UFO encounter in 2004 involving a white Tic Tac-shaped object exhibiting unconventional behaviour. Fravor believes it should be studied more closely for technological insights. David Grusch, a former USAF officer and intelligence official, claims the U.S. government possesses non-human spacecraft and deceased pilots through a secretive UFO recovery program. He alleges government involvement with the Vatican and the Five Eyes. A congressional hearing on UFOs revealed that around 95% of sightings go unreported due to stigma, and suggestions were made to use existing NASA databases to track sightings with actual sensor footage. The hearing emphasized the serious nature of the issue, acknowledging the presence of career officers with decades of experience and the commitment to transparency and pressure on the matter.

The legislation, outlined in multiple sections, aims to establish a comprehensive framework for handling and disclosing records related to Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs) within the United States government. It mandates the creation of the "Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Records Collection" at the National Archives and Records Administration, encompassing government records on UAPs, unknown origin technologies, and non-human intelligence. Records must be catalogued, preserved, and made digitally accessible. The legislation establishes a Review Board, independent of the government, responsible for determining the disclosure or postponement of records based on specific grounds, including threats to national security, confidentiality, and personal privacy. The Review Board's activities are subject to oversight by Senate and House committees, and it reports annually on its progress. The legislation seeks to enhance transparency while safeguarding sensitive information, ultimately leading to a comprehensive understanding of UAP-related phenomena.

## 2023, July - S.2103 — 118th Congress (2023-2024) #law #usadc

The Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024, detailed across pages 209 and 110, introduces amendments concerning Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs). The act defines key terms such as "Director" and "Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena" and expresses concern about potential technological surprises from foreign adversaries. It directs the Federal Government to increase awareness about historical exotic technology antecedents. Funding limitations are imposed on activities involving UAPs protected under special access or restricted access classifications, requiring full disclosure and justification to appropriate congressional committees, leadership, and the Director of the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office. These limitations encompass capturing, analyzing, protecting, and reverse-engineering UAP-related materials or technology. Contractors possessing such materials must notify the Director and provide them within set timeframes. Independent research and development funding linked to UAP materials may not be permissible without sharing it with the Director, who must notify Congress upon receiving UAP-related materials or information.

## 2023, June - UFO Whistleblower David Grusch - Full Interview 06/11/2023 #news #usava

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV4SRQRfDQs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV4SRQRfDQs) 

In June 2023, David Grusch, a former USAF officer and intelligence official, publicly asserted that the U.S. government operates a covert UFO recovery program, possessing non-human spacecraft and deceased pilots. Grusch lodged whistleblower complaints in 2022 and 2021 to disclose classified UFO information to the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. He alleges a collaborative effort involving the Vatican and Five Eyes to obtain a "non-human" craft recovered by Mussolini's government in 1933, expressing concerns about potential American casualties linked to concealing UFO information. Despite NASA and the U.S. Department of Defense's denial of extraterrestrial life and alien materials, Grusch's claims have triggered a congressional UFO hearing scheduled for July 26, 2023, led by the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability. A decorated combat officer with experience in intelligence agencies, Grusch claims to have witnessed documents detailing UFO retrievals and reverse engineering, positing that UFOs might originate from extra dimensions. Scepticism from some experts and scientists centres on the absence of concrete evidence to validate Grusch's assertions, which align with a pattern of similar claims from former federal department employees over the years, prompting questions about their credibility.

The Pentagon has established an organization to compile and coordinate reports of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) within the military. Given their impact on pilot training operations, the Biden administration treats UAP sightings as a serious and genuine concern. While committed to transparency, the administration acknowledges the importance of considering national security implications. The administration emphasizes that these phenomena have already affected pilot training in the air, leading to uncertainties about their nature and hindering skill development. While refraining from definitive statements about the origin of these phenomena, the administration emphasizes the need to comprehend and investigate these occurrences, aiming to understand the phenomenon's nature and implications better.

t is outlined that there have been recent developments regarding Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) or Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs). The United States Department of Defense has released information about these phenomena, emphasizing their potential impact on military operations and the need for rigorous scientific analysis to understand and respond to them. The document also mentions the lack of credible evidence for extraterrestrial activity and the establishment of the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office to coordinate efforts and gather data on UAPs in the United States. Regarding Australia, it is stated that there are no specific reporting protocols or records for UAP or UFO sightings within the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). Instead, such observations are subject to standard aviation safety reporting procedures. The document further reveals that there have been no records of unidentified aircraft sightings or unusual events related to UAPs in the past 20 years within the RAAF. Additionally, there has been no communication or discussions between the RAAF and the United States regarding UAPs. The document concludes with the confirmation that the Department of Defense does not have a protocol for reporting or recording UAPs or UFOs, with the Air Force having discontinued their handling of such reports in 1996 due to a lack of scientific justification.

## 2023, February 14 - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau received a secret memo laying out how the Canadian government was responding to the Feb. 11 Yukon incident. In addition, it stated the "full exploitation" of whatever the U.S. Air Force shot down over the waters of Alaska on Feb. 10 had "not yet been completed." Reports a few days later stated that the U.S. had called off the search for the wreckage of the downed object. Exactly what kind of intelligence exploitation this is referring to is unclear.

The "Memorandum for the Prime Minister," transmitted Feb. 14. The memo expressed concern that the indigenous hunters might accidentally find the object during their caribou hunt. It also explained that while CAF CF-18s Hornets had been scrambled to intercept the object, “F-22s were better located based on time, space and fading light.”

Reports a few days later stated that the U.S. had called off the search for the wreckage of the downed object. Exactly what kind of intelligence exploitation this is referring to is unclear. The "Memorandum for the Prime Minister," transmitted Feb. 14

## 2023, January - US Air Force Reports Mysterious Gulf of Mexico Incident to Pentagon's UFO Office

[https://reddit.com/r/UFOs/s/Qg73UQiz7f](https://reddit.com/r/UFOs/s/Qg73UQiz7f) 

The Department of Defense (DoD) has officially confirmed to Liberation Times that the United States Air Force (USAF) has submitted a report about an incident involving an unknown object that occurred earlier this year to its Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) office, known as the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO). The incident centred around a USAF pilot stationed at Florida's Eglin Air Force Base, whose sensor systems suddenly malfunctioned as his aircraft approached a UAP over the Gulf of Mexico, sparked concern. Florida representative Matt Gaetz, who had been alerted and briefed on the incident, addressed it during the Congressional UAP Hearing in July 2023: “One of the pilots goes to check out that diamond formation \[viewed on radar\] and sees a large floating, what I can only describe as an orb, again, like I said, not have any human capability that I'm aware of.”

During an open hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee on April 19, the Department of Defense (DoD) provided insights into Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena. Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick, the director of the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), displayed videos portraying an unidentified object with an atmospheric wake or cavitation behind it. The video was recorded by an MQ-9 forward-looking infrared video sensor in South Asia, tracking another MQ-9. AARO conducted a comprehensive analysis involving full motion video, additional footage, and commercial flight data, leading them to tentatively conclude that the object is likely a commercial aircraft and the trailing cavitation results from video compression. The investigation is still pending final review, suggesting the process is ongoing. The supplementary footage presented exhibited apparent back-and-forth motion due to the sensor attempting to zoom in on the swiftly moving Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon (UAP) rather than the MQ-9.

## 2023, July 7 - Microbiologist EBO post. Subsequently deleted #leak #LARPing #conspiracy #atlanticocean

The shared DNA system's resemblance implies a common origin, likely stemming from a similar physicochemical process and initial conditions. Non-coding sequences, once dubbed "junk DNA," are vital for gene expression regulation through epigenetics. The 64bp gene address mentioned may solely function in genetic engineering, possibly lacking relevance within EBOs' bodies. EBOs employ a 4bp chromosomal address, capable of distinguishing 256 chromosomes, surpassing the 16 observed in their genome. Despite this, the uniformity of intergenic regions in EBOs raises concerns about potential unintended interactions and chromosomal fragility. The notion of an "index" system in EBOs may pose challenges due to shared core palindromic sequences and minor differences between target index sequences.

## 2022 - United States Congress hearings on UFOs  #law #usa

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022UnitedStatesCongresshearingsonUFOs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_United_States_Congress_hearings_on_UFOs) 

On May 17, 2022, the United States House Intelligence Subcommittee on Counterterrorism, Counterintelligence, and Counterproliferation convened public congressional hearings to address military reports of unexplained aerial phenomena (UAPs). Marking the first such hearings in over 50 years, the event delved into the history of UFO investigations, including the disbandment of Project Blue Book in 1969 due to a perceived lack of national security threat. Media reports in 2017 and the 2020 Covid relief bill highlighted secretive Pentagon efforts to study UAPs. The June 2021 unclassified report, mandated by the Covid relief bill, revealed that 144 UAP incidents dating back to 2004 remained unexplained, prompting a call for further investigation. In November 2021, the Pentagon established the Airborne Object Identification and Management Synchronization Group (AOIMSG) to continue the work of the Navy's Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force. The 2022 hearings featured military officials testifying about the rising number of sightings, the necessity of interagency cooperation, and the potential threats of foreign hypersonic weapons programs. Declassified images and footage of UFOs were presented during the hearings, underlining the need for ongoing study of these phenomena.

## 2021, June - UFO Report (U.S. Intelligence) #report

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFOReport(U.S.Intelligence)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFO_Report_(U.S._Intelligence)) 

Issued on June 25, 2021, by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Preliminary Assessment: Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) Report offers a comprehensive overview of UAPs, compiling 144 observations by the U.S. Armed Forces from 2004 to 2021. The report highlights that the UAP Task Force struggled to ascertain the origins of most sightings (143 out of 144), identifying only one case as a "large, deflating balloon." Notable characteristics of UAPs include their unconventional flight behaviour, like hovering against the wind and sudden manoeuvres without apparent propulsion. The report classifies potential explanations into airborne clutter, atmospheric phenomena, government or industry developmental programs, foreign adversary systems, and an "other" category. Although not attributing the phenomena to extraterrestrial life, the report underscores the need for further study and investment. Some UAP sightings correlate with radio frequency energy, prompting exploration into potential groundbreaking technology. U.S. Senator Marco Rubio expressed concerns about national security implications, and the report's classified annexe was presented to congressional intelligence committees. Despite the categorizations, the report doesn't offer a conclusive explanation for all the observed UAPs.

In 2021, the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) utilized its classified analysis system called "Sentient" to detect an unconventional "tic tac" shaped object. Sentient, an advanced tool with classified details, was designed to process diverse data, anticipate future events, and direct satellites. While the full extent of its capabilities remains classified, it was disclosed in 2022 that Sentient can identify UFOs. Documents released under the Freedom of Information Act #FOIA by the NRO revealed that Sentient detected and tracked unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) on May 6, 2021. The object's shape resembled the "tic tac" observed in the famous 2004 USS Nimitz incident, suggesting it was not a sensor artefact. The NRO's redacted PowerPoint presentation indicated the involvement of the UAP Task Force, NRO, and potentially a contractor in discussions about using Sentient's capabilities for UAP detection. Due to redactions, details about another "vessel" 15.5 miles away from the UAP were unclear. FOIA requests by The Black Vault and others aim to uncover more information about this UAP sighting and Sentient's functions.

Harry Reid reflects on his enduring interest in UFOs, tracing it back to his attendance at a conference on unidentified aerial phenomena. In 2007, he collaborated with fellow senators to secure funding for the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, which investigated UFO reports involving American military personnel. The government's exploration of UFOs persists through the Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon Task Force. Reid's intrigue with the enigmatic stems from his upbringing in rural Nevada, where he pondered the mysteries of the night sky. Despite his limited scientific background, Reid has a deep curiosity and inquisitiveness. He visited Area 51, a classified Air Force testing site, and emphasized the importance of transparent discussions and scientific examination of UFO encounters. While he believes there's information about UFOs that can be shared with the public without compromising national security, he also acknowledges the complexity of these phenomena. Reid underscores the need to approach UFO research with a scientific lens, aiming not to prove the existence of extraterrestrial life but to remain open to the possibility if scientific evidence supports it. He humbly acknowledges his ongoing quest for knowledge in this field.

Former Israeli space security chief Haim Eshed claimed that humanity has been engaged with extraterrestrials from a "galactic federation." According to Eshed, these extraterrestrial beings have requested their presence to remain undisclosed due to humanity's lack of readiness to comprehend it fully. He disclosed that agreements for cooperation had been established between humans and aliens, including an "underground base in the depths of Mars" involving American astronauts and alien representatives. Eshed further stated that President Donald Trump was informed about the aliens' existence and was on the verge of revealing this information but was cautioned against doing so to prevent causing "mass hysteria." While there was no response from the White House or Israeli officials, NASA acknowledged its pursuit of detecting extraterrestrial life, although concrete evidence remains elusive.

1\. The U.S. government has allegedly been conducting a top-secret investigation into UFOs for over 70 years, with the level of secrecy surpassing even that of the development of the nuclear bomb. 

2\. The program has purportedly collected over 50 extraterrestrial (ET) craft and over 100 different alien bodies, along with hundreds of thousands of feet of high-quality film taken of the on-site recoveries.

3\. The recovery teams, called the Blue Berets, were typically males with no families or relatives, often orphans, to ensure complete secrecy and easy elimination in case of infractions.

4\. Recovered crafts were transported and hidden in complete secrecy, with some taken to Area 51 and other secret facilities in Nevada. 

5\. Area 51 was initially prepared by Seabee crews who dug several layers underground and was kept secret until the early 90s.

6\. More underground hangars were built under the Tonopah Test Range in the late 70s, which connected with huge tunnels and connected with the Groom Lake and Papoose Dry Lake underground hangars.

7\. In the early 80s, another massive underground facility was built under the Paiute Mesa, with a dual runway and hangar under Gold Flat.

8\. By the early 2000s, all facilities, including TTR, Groom Lake, Papoose, and Paiute Mesa, were connected with enormous underground tunnels and hangars.

9\. To staff these facilities and maintain secrecy, a maglev high-speed subway was allegedly built from under the Luxor in Las Vegas.

10\. The Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon Task Force (UAPTF) is seen by the Pentagon as a brilliant scam to hide its deep involvement in UFOs. It provides the public with a few 'tic tacs,' rolling bb's, and non-identifiable radar scans while allegedly hiding a vast collection of ET artifacts.

Details: At approximately 10:30 hours, I (b) (6) was notified by the Central Alarm Station (CAS) that they heard over the escort channel about a possible drone sighting. The CAS Operator reported hearing escorts at building 815 in the Process Area discussing a drone sighting at around 10:27 hours. I subsequently contacted Security Escorts (b) (6) and (b) (6) at building 815 in the Process Area. Both escorts confirmed the sighting, stating, "I saw a round silver drone flying around the Process Area and periodically stopping and hovering for several seconds. It continued flying to the north of my location, paused, and hovered for several more seconds. Afterward, it moved over the area for several minutes and departed to the southeast. It was flying at a high altitude, just below the clouds." The drone-like object was flying at a distance and height that prevented (b) (6) from identifying its characteristics. I also made contact with (b) (6), who confirmed that there were no scheduled drone activities or lights for Site 300 on that day.

## 2019 - Pentagon UFO videos #FOIA #alien

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PentagonUFOvideos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagon_UFO_videos) 

The Pentagon UFO videos consist of visual recordings captured by US Navy fighter jets in 2004, 2014, 2015, and 2019, depicting encounters with unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP). After gaining significant media attention and speculation, the Pentagon officially declassified and released these videos in 2020 and 2021. Notable instances include Commander David Fravor's investigation of a possible UFO target in 2004, observing a white, oval-shaped object hovering above the ocean, and videos from 2014-2015 showing unknown aerial objects encountered by pilots from the USS Theodore Roosevelt carrier strike group. Various explanations for these videos include instrument malfunctions, observational illusions, conventional aircraft or aerial devices, and speculative ideas about alien spacecraft. Some experts suggest the UFOs might be drones operated by foreign nations to assess US defenses, while others consider possibilities like electronic warfare or sensor errors. The US Navy revised its reporting procedures to encourage pilots to report unexplained aerial observations. The 2021 preliminary UFO report by the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) did not provide a definitive conclusion on the nature of these UAPs, presenting five potential categories of explanation. The investigation into UAP phenomena continues, focusing on implications for aircraft safety and national security.

Former Senate majority leader Harry Reid mentioned that he had talked with President Bill Clinton about aerial phenomena and UFOs during his presidency. Reid noted that Clinton's curiosity extended to a wide range of topics, and while the conversation was passing, Clinton was interested in the subject. Reid also mentioned that John Podesta, one of Clinton's top staffers who worked for him at Walmart, has publicly supported UFO disclosure. Reid's interaction with Clinton on the topic suggests that even during Clinton's time in office, there was some level of interest and discussion regarding UFOs.

## 2017,  March 27 - Anonymous website partially encoded publishes an article on “turning the vehicle into a pilot’s prosthetic extension.” In the article are vague examples of how to replicate the piloting features of a UAP: “there must be no difference between the aircraft and the crew…you cannot just take a human being and fit him with all this array of sensors; you first need to tweak the human somehow to better exploit the capabilities of this technology…we need to go a step further from the current paradigm of manned aircrafts and shift toward a paradigm of aircrafts that behave like a human.” Elsewhere on the site, allegedly non-public reports from Raytheon and Lockheed are cited. #news #rumor #usa

Former Senate majority leader Harry Reid was key in initiating the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP), a Pentagon program focused on investigating reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The program was active from late 2008 through 2011 and cost taxpayers $22 million. Much of the funding went to an aerospace research company led by Robert Bigelow, a close ally of Reid, who is also collaborating with NASA on space projects. The program was run secretly within the Pentagon, led by military intelligence official Luis Elizondo. Although the Defense Department officially stated that the program ended in 2012, insiders suggest that it continues investigating UFO episodes reported by service members while performing their other defense duties. The existence of such a program demonstrates an ongoing interest in monitoring potential unidentified aerial threats.

Avi Loeb, a prominent astrophysicist at Harvard University, has gained attention for his groundbreaking research in astrophysics, particularly on topics such as black holes and the early universe. However, he has also stirred controversy by delving into the subject of space aliens and their potential existence. His involvement with the Breakthrough Starshot project, aimed at sending light sail spacecraft to nearby stars, drew significant interest. In 2017, Loeb's focus shifted when the interstellar object 'Oumuamua entered the scene. The object's peculiar properties, including its shape, reflectivity, and acceleration, led Loeb to propose the idea that it might be an extraterrestrial light sail, a notion that has garnered both media attention and skepticism from fellow scientists. Despite criticism, Loeb stands firm in his belief that the scientific community should openly explore unconventional ideas, including the search for technological signs of alien life. He has published a book, "Extraterrestrial: The First Sign of Intelligent Life Beyond Earth," to further discuss his persfirmly believespective and challenge the norms of scientific inquiry. Loeb emphasizes the importance of genuine curiosity, evidence-based exploration, and open dialogue in shaping the future of scientific discovery.

## 2016, April  - Tom DeLonge states he was told by unnamed “advisors” that there were multiple UAP crashes and recoveries. The USG and its contractors hid it, created a “pickup game” of counterintelligence, DeLonge claims, and adds that it was at one time bigger than the Manhattan Project. He states it is currently held by a private corporation where “certain laws” protect their own breakthroughs and proprietary assets; DeLonge adds that he asked the advisors if the crash recovery program(s) were legal or if they were illegal. He claims the advisors showed him an “exact law,” with an exact paragraph and number on a “government website” to justify what they were doing as legal.

## 2016, March 27 - Tom DeLonge states in early 2016 that he was told by his CIA “advisors” that when UAP crashes happen, intelligence, military and private industry are pooled together. “They’ve” been using private companies/publicly traded companies to keep the secret information “protected” through non-governmental organizations. #rumor #contentdeleted #usa

DeLonge also states he met with the CIA (2015?). DeLonge also states the MJ-12 documents are not accurate and in reality, things are more fragmented; it’s a “very, very small group” of people at the top putting it all together and pulling in what data they’re able to get from other areas of IC/private industry. DeLonge states he was told “the Others” are manipulating countries against the US/West hegemony.

## 2015, November 5  - The National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) states in response to a FOIA request that it has no documentation related to UFOs. It states the topic is “outside of the scope of NRO responsibilities; furthermore, the NRO has conducted numerous searches…in the past, and has located no records.” This contradicts emails released by the NRO on 8 April 2022, which show extensive coordination with the DOD’s Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force (UAPTF), and states the NRO contributed to the UAPTF report to Congress “tied to its collection efforts.” This implies UAP are being detected on NRO platforms, and suggests the FOIA response in 2015 wasn’t accurate if they were being detected in 2015 or before. #FOIA #usa

## 2015, March 13 - Kit Green states the records of Ret. USAF John Burroughs, Rendlesham Forest incident witness, were legally classified by the DOD. Green states only a handful of medical records were classified and the reasons were because inside the doctors notes, nursing, etc. are a “myriad of references to Special Access Projects” and the names of other adjacent and ancillary programs and projects that can not be disentangled and could uncover active/recent projects related to Rendlesham. Green states broadband non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation caused the injuries, the data is sparse and it is not well understood or peer reviewed.

## 2015, March 6 - Former USG contractor Bob Fish tells Clinton campaign manager John Podesta that in a TS/SCI organization in El Segundo, CA, he had lunch with a senior USAF NCO who worked for Project Blue Book in the 1970s after it had publicly disbanded. He was an ELINT technician who flew in RC-135s from MacDill AFB in Florida. He allegedly told Fish they were sometimes diverted to track UAP off the east coast of Florida; the UAP allegedly came from a hotspot east of Miami, north of Bermuda. A specific frequency emanated from them, and UAP evidence was sent to a “dedicated” USAF intelligence officer. #rumor #wiki #ysacalifornia

## 2014 - Pope Francis says he would baptize aliens: 'Who are we to close doors #quote

Pope Francis expressed his openness to baptizing aliens during a homily on acceptance and inclusion within the Catholic Church. He referred to a Bible story about pagans' conversion to Christianity and emphasized accepting the Holy Spirit, even if it comes in unimaginable forms. The Pope humorously described a hypothetical scenario of baptizing a Martian with green skin, long nose, and big ears, akin to children's drawings. He highlighted the historical struggle within Christianity to accept various manifestations of God's presence and questioned the right to close doors if the Lord shows the way. This isn't the first instance of the Vatican discussing the idea of baptizing extraterrestrial beings, as a former astronomer of Pope Benedict XVI also mentioned willingness to baptize aliens if they asked.

 

## 2014 - Testimony under oath. Ryan “FOBS” Graves, a former F-18 pilot in the U.S. Navy with over a decade of service UAP (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena) events that he witnessed during my service. #new #alien (2023-08-10)

[https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Ryan-HOC-Testimony.pdf](https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Ryan-HOC-Testimony.pdf) 

Beginning in 2014, I was stationed near Virginia Beach, and my squadron, VFA-11, was equipped with upgraded radar systems. It was then that we began detecting unexplained UAP in our airspace. Initially considered software glitches, we confirmed their physical presence through infrared sensors. Over time, these UAP sightings became commonplace, even routine, and were corroborated by multiple sensor systems. These encounters led to open discussions among aircrew, forming an "open secret" within our squadron.

One significant event occurred during a training mission in Warning Area W-72, ten miles off Virginia Beach's coast. On this day in 2014, as our F/A-18F Super Hornets entered the airspace, my fellow pilot and I observed a dark gray cube encased within a clear sphere, seemingly motionless against the wind, positioned directly at our entry point. In response to avoid a collision, both aircraft were forced to take evasive maneuvers, abruptly terminating the mission. Despite submitting a safety report, there was no official acknowledgment or further reporting mechanism for such encounters. These UAP encounters displayed extraordinary capabilities that surpassed our understanding of existing technology. Their acceleration exceeded Mach 1, remained motionless against strong winds, and outperformed our fighter jets, operating seamlessly throughout the day. These objects exhibited no conventional features like wings, flaps, or engines. As an engineer, I struggled to explain these phenomena.

I founded Americans for Safe Aerospace to offer support, research, and public education for aircrew impacted by UAP encounters. Our organization has connected with nearly 5,000 members and worked with over 30 UAP witnesses who have come forward with their experiences. In conclusion, I aim today to emphasize the urgency of addressing these UAP events. As a pilot and witness, I firmly believe advanced UAP sightings are a significant national security and aviation safety concern. The American people, and the global community, deserve transparency and serious investigation into these encounters.

## 2013 - The CIA publicly acknowledges the existence of Area 51 for the first time, following a FOIA request filed in 2005, and it declassifies documents detailing its history and purpose #FOIA

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area51](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_51) 

Area 51, also known as Homey Airport or Groom Lake, is a secretive facility within the Nevada Test and Training Range, operated by the US Air Force (USAF) and administered by Edwards Air Force Base. While its operations are undisclosed, it's believed to be involved in testing experimental aircraft and weapons systems. The USAF and CIA acquired the site in 1955 to test the Lockheed U-2 aircraft. Its secrecy has led to conspiracy theories and UFO legends. Though not officially labeled a secret base, all activities are classified as Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI). The CIA confirmed its existence in 2013 after declassifying documents following a Freedom of Information Act request. Situated about 83 miles north-northwest of Las Vegas, Area 51 and the surrounding region, including the town of Rachel on the "Extraterrestrial Highway," have become a popular tourist attraction.

[https://youtu.be/GLU0NSTC9oU](https://youtu.be/GLU0NSTC9oU) 

The account details a UFO crash witnessed in the jungle, with encounters with alien beings. The egg-shaped UFO emitted a purplish-green substance, had hatched, and seemed organic. The beings communicated telepathically, projecting non-harm intentions. Mysterious men in black took the witness into custody, who was then interrogated by the DOE and threatened not to reveal the incident. The crash occurred near a radar installation with advanced military equipment. The UFO might have been shot down due to airspace violations. Despite potential disbelief, the witness struggled to accept the encounter's implications and felt compelled to share the story.

Bell and Mover later told BAASS that they believed advanced technology was being held at aerospace contractor facilities under government supervision. Mover and Bell became fearful of moving forward. By late 2011, DHS Deputy Secretary Jane Holl Lute, Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis Phyllis Green, and others decided not to contract BAASS within DHS.

We can't verify if the channel creator and/or uploader is in fact a single individual and really named Ivan. For the sake of simplicity however, we continue to refer to the uploader as Ivan and address him as a single individual throughout this website.

According to the information provided, the uploaded clips are small samples selectively taken from a larger collection of video material. The original footage is apparently spread across several physical tapes. Ivan provides detailed lists of tape numbers and timestamps for all the clips presented, even embeds an animated timestamp into the first two videos to indicate where in the original footage the sequence was taken from.

## 2011, February - Former Canadian defense minister Paul Hellyer #leak #news #alien

[https://www.cnet.com/culture/canadas-ex-defense-minister-u-s-knows-how-aliens-can-make-us-greener/](https://www.cnet.com/culture/canadas-ex-defense-minister-u-s-knows-how-aliens-can-make-us-greener/) 

Former Canadian defense minister Paul Hellyer asserts that the U.S. possesses knowledge of UFO technology and has harnessed extraterrestrial technology for new energy forms. He criticizes the historical human response of hostility to alien craft and suggests that a shadow government with black ops facilities has developed energy sources from this technology. Hellyer claims personal UFO sightings and advocates for understanding rather than aggression towards extraterrestrials. He proposes that sharing advanced energy knowledge from extraterrestrials could positively impact the environment and shape humanity's future if the U.S. government acknowledges this information.

## 2010,  October - USAF personnel at Francis E. Warren AFB near

Cheyenne, WY see a large cigar-shaped UAP above its missile field. Later that day, the missile site loses communications with 50 Minuteman III nuclear missiles, affecting five Missile Alert Facilities Alpha through Echo comprising the 319th Strategic Missile Squadron. The USAF commander of the squadron tells its members not to talk to journalists about the “things they may or may not have seen” and threatens severe penalties for violating security.
   - In Pascagoula, Mississippi, Charles Hickson and Calvin Parker reported being abducted by alien beings while fishing. They described being taken aboard a craft where they encountered humanoid creatures. This case is one of the earliest and most famous abduction reports in the United States.

## 1977 - Attorney Daniel P. Sheehan, at the request of Congressional Research Service researcher Marcia S. Smith, claims to visit the Madison Building at the Library of Congress to look at “classified sections of Project Blue Book.” Sheehan claims to see photos of a flying disc embedded in snow surrounded by USAF personnel wearing parkas. Symbols are present on the side of the crashed disc. If true, this contradicts the findings of the Blue Book that were delivered to Congress and the American people, stating that a lack of physical evidence was a key reason why UAP was not worthy of future study.

## 1975, November 5 - Travis Walton Abduction  

In Arizona’s Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest, logger Travis Walton vanished after he and six coworkers encountered a brilliant disc-shaped object. Five days later, Walton reappeared with no clear memory of his absence, though he eventually described vivid experiences of interacting with apparent non-human entities aboard a craft. The case received extensive publicity and remains one of the most famous abduction reports in UFO lore.

The letter is from someone named O.P. Elliot, reporting sightings of green lights in the years 1948 through 1951 at Les Alamos. They mention that these sightings typically occurred at night in the Jemez Mountains. There's also a mention of objects flying over Les Alamos in formation during the afternoon. The writer suggests checking with a person named W. D. Wilson and accessing the protective force logs for more information on these sightings.

## 1968, July 14 - Two interesting "UFO" files on the Defense Intelligence Agency website. One contains a letter stating: "There is absolutely no doubt that an Alien Race is carrying out a construction project on this planet." 

If you go to the DIA website, there are two files filed under the "other available records" section, called "ufo1.pdf" and "ufo2.pdf". One document in "ufo1.pdf" shows a letter from New Zealand pilot, "Captain B. L. Cathie" to a "Colonel L. H. Walker" at the US Embassy in Wellington. In the letter Cathie states. "There is absolutely no doubt that an Alien Race is carrying out a construction project on this planet." It also contains many of his handwritten notes on the matter.

## 1967, October 4 - Shag Harbour Incident

### 1967, March 16 - Malmstrom Air Force Base UFO incident that took place in 1967

The incident at Malmstrom Air Force Base is one of the most significant events in the history of UFO-related phenomena. It took place in Montana, USA, in March 1967. Multiple credible witnesses, most notably Captain Robert Salas, reported that unidentified flying objects (UFOs) were sighted over the base and that they somehow interfered with the operation of nuclear missiles stationed there. According to Salas, on the morning of March 16th, 1967, an airman reported seeing a strange red glowing object hovering just above the front gate. At roughly the same time, alarms started going off at the missile sites, indicating a "no-go" condition, meaning the nuclear missiles were no longer operational. All ten missiles at the site, one by one, went offline in a matter of seconds, which was highly unusual and almost impossible under normal conditions. Captain Salas has publicly stated that he was told by base personnel that the UFOs were the reason for the missile shutdown. However, the U.S. Air Force has officially denied any involvement by UFOs in the incident. According to the USAF, the missile shutdown was due to a technical malfunction.

## 1967, March - Case: A fighter jet ‘disintegrates’ when it prepares to fire missiles at a UFO.

[https://medium.com/@brknylmn/case-a-fighter-jet-disintegrates-when-it-prepares-to-fire-missiles-at-a-ufo-march-1967-cuba-cd69ba93f647](https://medium.com/@brknylmn/case-a-fighter-jet-disintegrates-when-it-prepares-to-fire-missiles-at-a-ufo-march-1967-cuba-cd69ba93f647) 

 A pair of MiG-21 jet fighters were scrambled to inspect the enigmatic invader, which they eventually discovered and observed to resemble a big, metallic sphere devoid of wings or any kind of propulsion system. The flight leader was immediately told that the object had failed to reply to radio contact attempts and was instructed to fire at the plane. As the flight leader armed his missiles and prepared to fire at the object, Cuban Air Defense Headquarters listened as the screaming voice of his wingman came over their radios, stating that his leader’s aircraft had just disintegrated completely, with no visible explosion or sign of an attack. Immediately afterwards, the weird metallic sphere accelerated upward from its altitude of approximately 33,000 feet to over 98,000 feet and headed southeast into South America.

## 1964, April 24 - Lonnie Zamora incident

On April 24, 1964, at approximately 5:45 p.m., Socorro Police radio dispatcher Nep Lopez received a radio call from Sergeant Lonnie Zamora reporting a possible motor vehicle accident. Zamora advised Lopez that he would be "checking the car down in the arroyo".  Shortly after, Lopez received another radio call from Zamora asking Lopez to look out of the window, to see if he could see an object. When Lopez asked Zamora to describe it, Zamora said, "it looks like a balloon" and requested New Mexico State Police Sergeant Chavez meet him at his location. When Chavez arrived, he asked Zamora what the trouble was. Zamora led him to examine some burning brush. When other police officers arrived, they noted patches of smoldering grass and brush. The object looked like a white egg.

## 1961, September 19 - Betty and Barney Hill Abduction  

This incident is widely considered the first well-publicized report of an alien abduction in the United States. Betty and Barney Hill claimed to have observed a bright object while driving on a rural road in New Hampshire and then experienced an unexplained period of lost time. Later, under hypnosis, they recounted detailed memories of being taken aboard a UFO and subjected to medical examinations by non-human beings.

The National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena was formed in 1956, with the organization's corporate charter being approved October 24.\[15\] Hillenkoetter was on NICAP's board of governors from about 1957 until 1962.\[16\] Donald E. Keyhoe, NICAP director and Hillenkoetter's Naval Academy classmate, wrote that Hillenkoetter wanted public disclosure of UFO evidence.\[17\] Perhaps Hillenkoetter's best-known statement on the subject was in 1960 in a letter to Congress, as reported in The New York Times: "Behind the scenes, high-ranking Air Force officers are soberly concerned about UFOs. But through official secrecy and ridicule, many citizens are led to believe the unknown flying objects are nonsense.

[https://youtu.be/SX8Ata2YSCU](https://youtu.be/SX8Ata2YSCU) 

During the Cold War, recently revealed secret files indicate that two U.S. fighter planes were dispatched to intercept and potentially shoot down an unidentified flying object (UFO) over the English countryside. The incident, disclosed through National Archives files in London, occurred in May 1957. Pilot Milton Torres, now living in Miami, recounted his experience when he was seconds away from firing rockets at the object, which exhibited erratic movement and had a radar reading resembling "a flying aircraft carrier." Despite reaching speeds exceeding 7,600 mph (12,000 kph) and moments from firing, the UFO abruptly vanished from radar. Following the incident, Torres was cautioned by an undisclosed individual, threatening national security repercussions if he spoke about it. The documents don't offer an official explanation for the event, with speculation ranging from secret military experiments to possible UFO involvement.

## 1958, October 1958 - USN veteran Chester C. Grusinski states during his service on the USS Franklin D Roosevelt, while near Cuba, witnessed a cigar-shaped object orange in color on the deck. #brokenlinks #quote

Gruskinski states he could see silhouettes through windows in the object, “You could tell they weren’t human.” The object turned red and it “vanished.” After the incident, Grusinski states crew members who discussed the UAP event were transferred. Grusinksi stated later that other USS Roosevelt veterans met at a reunion recalled 8-10 separate UAP events connected with the carrier, which was the first to carry nuclear weapons and the only to carry the hydrogen bomb. Grusinksi says deck logs from 1958-59 were redacted.

## 1957 - Levelland

In the film Close Encounters of the Third Kind, there’s a famous scene where a UFO makes the electronics in a car go haywire. The real-life inspiration for that scene came from an incident in 1957, when dozens of citizens of Levelland, Texas, individually reported seeing a rocket or strange lights that interfered with their vehicles: Engines died, lights cut out.

## 1956, October 24 - The National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) is an unidentified flying object (UFO) research group that was most active in the United States from the 1950s to the 1980s. It remains active primarily as an informational depository on the UFO phenomenon.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Investigations_Committee_On_Aerial_Phenomena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Investigations_Committee_On_Aerial_Phenomena) 

[https://www.nicap.org/](https://www.nicap.org/) 

NICAP was a non-profit organization and faced financial collapse many times in its existence, due in no small part to business ineptitude among the group's directors. Following a wave of nationally publicized UFO incidents in the mid-1960s, NICAP's membership spiked dramatically and only then did the organization become financially stable. However, following publication of the Condon Report in 1968, NICAP's membership declined sharply, and the organization again fell into long-term financial decline and disarray.

## 1955 - A 1955 memo has recently been further declassified by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), chronicling a unique event: the sighting of a “saucer-like” craft by a former U.S. Senator #FOIA

A recently further declassified 1955 CIA memo highlights a remarkable event during the Cold War involving former U.S. Senator Richard B. Russell's sighting of a "saucer-like" craft in Russia. The memo, authored by Herbert Scoville Jr., details an interview with Russell on October 27, 1955, during which he observed a greenish-yellow ball rising quickly while on a train journey out of Baku. Russell's skepticism transformed into certainty as he and his group witnessed a second similar object ascending into the sky. The objects exhibited a "whirling" motion and a "yellowish glow," observed at a significant altitude without associated lights. Notably, the incident occurred during a train trip personally requested by Russell, dispelling notions of a staged event. Russell also observed military barracks, personnel, and radar installations, including a nearby "big egg beater object," during a motor trip between Moscow and Borodino. The incident was previously mentioned in a 1955 "Current Intelligence Bulletin" and Project Blue Book files, with the full memo's declassification prompted by a Mandatory Declassification Review case.

## 1955 - JFK files have a loose link to UFO #FOIA #new #limited (2023-08-07)

President Joe Biden has approved the release of certain files linked to John F. Kennedy's assassination, but approximately 4,684 documents remain classified. The National Archives has already made public several confidential documents related to the 1963 assassination, drawing from various agencies like the CIA, FBI, and State Department. Notably, one document discloses that a CIA official, Reuben Efron, intercepted Lee Harvey Oswald's mail before JFK's assassination and experienced a UFO sighting in 1955. Efron's sighting involved observing "flying saucers" during a train journey in the Soviet Union with Senator Richard Russell and an Army colonel. Some conspiracy theorists speculate about Efron's potential involvement in the Kennedy assassination, prompting calls for more UFO-related information through bipartisan efforts.

## 1955 - Depicts a crashed Flying Saucer that was reportedly shot down by RED WING pilots flying F-94 "interceptor" fighter jets. #debunked 

This photograph, taken in 1955, depicts a crashed Flying Saucer that was reportedly shot down by RED WING pilots flying F-94 "interceptor" fighter jets. The incident occurred over The Bull of the Woods, a region in central Oregon near Welcome Lake. The source of this smuggled photo remains unknown. This artist recreation from the book 'Ominous' by Wayne Sturgill perfectly matches the recent alleged UAP/UFO photos that have come out via Ron James.

 From July 12 to 29, 1952, a series of UFO sightings occurred over Washington, D.C., becoming known as the Washington flap or the Invasion of Washington. Notably, the events of July 19–20 and July 26–27 saw increased UFO activity. Air traffic controllers, pilots, and radar centers reported unidentified flying objects. On July 19–20, air traffic controller Edward Nugent spotted seven objects on radar, leading to more unknown blips observed by radar centers and sightings by airline pilot S.C. Pierman. On July 26–27, a National Airlines flight crew and radar centers at National Airport and Andrews Air Force Base tracked more UFOs. U.S. Air Force jets were scrambled to intercept, with limited success, while ground personnel and experts debated the cause. The sightings ignited media coverage and intrigue, and despite investigations, the nature of the objects remains unresolved.

## 1947 - Maury Island Incident

On June 21, 1947, in Maury Island, Washington, Harold Dahl and his son Al reported encountering UFOs while working near the Puget Sound. Dahl claimed that UFOs dropped molten slag-like material onto his boat, injuring his son and killing his dog. He later received a series of threatening messages from individuals identified as "men in black." The incident is often considered one of the first UFO sightings but is also regarded by many as a hoax or misinterpretation of a military testing incident.

## 1951, August 25 - Lubbock Lights

On the evening of August 25, 1951, three science professors from Texas Tech were enjoying an evening outdoors in Lubbock, when they looked up and saw a semicircle of lights flying above them at a high speed. Over the next few days, dozens of reports flooded in from across town—Texas Tech freshman Carl Hart Jr., even snapped photos of the so-called Lubbock Lights phenomenon, which were published in newspapers across the country and LIFE magazine.

This document discusses the presence of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in the United States and speculates on their potential Soviet origin and motives. It notes patterns in UFO sightings across the country and dismisses the idea that they are merely rumor-induced, suggesting instead that these sightings may represent advanced Soviet aircraft. The document posits three possible reasons for these Soviet UFOs: first, to sow doubt in the efficacy of U.S. atomic weapons as a propaganda tactic; second, for photographic reconnaissance, possibly to map certain U.S. regions; and third, as a means to test U.S. defense capabilities, crucial information for any potential Soviet strategic planning. This document thus highlights the complex and uncertain nature of the UFO phenomenon during its written period. Among the incidents reported, many statements by reliable and experienced persons tend to confirm that flying objects have been seen. Approximately 210 incidents have been reported. The observers reporting such incidents are trained and experienced U.S. Weather Bureau personnel, USAF-rated officers, experienced civilian pilots, technicians associated with various research projects and technicians employed by commercial airlines. The description of such objects seems to fall roughly into three categories: (1) Silver disks or balls, approximating a Horten wing-type aircraft; (2) Balls of fire of various colors and intensities; (3) Cigar or pencil-shaped objects similar in appearance to V-2 type rockets in horizontal flight. The number of configurations might be further reduced with the following considerations in mind: Silver disks or balls have, for the greater part, been observed in daylight, and a number under clear weather conditions with visibility unlimited. In most instances, balls of fire have been observed at night. Cigar, or pencil-shaped objects, have been sighted in fewer numbers but with about equal distribution in daylight and at night. A few accounts tell of the disks having a rough cigar shape when viewed while maneuvering. Some of the disks are described as having luminosity in daylight. It, therefore, is possible that a single type of object may be involved in all sightings, and differences in description may result from viewing the objects at various angles and under differing conditions of visibility.

## 1950 - Prime Minister Winston Churchill ordered a UFO sighting to be kept secret to prevent "mass panic." #FOIA

[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-10853905](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-10853905) 

Newly declassified files reveal that the UK government treated UFO sightings seriously in the 1950s, engaging intelligence officials in discussions and requesting weekly reports on UFO encounters. In 1957, the Joint Intelligence Committee received reports detailing approximately one UFO sighting per week. It's noted that during World War II, Prime Minister Winston Churchill allegedly ordered the secrecy of a UFO sighting to prevent potential mass panic. Notably, UFO reports surged in 1996, coinciding with the popularity of the TV show The X-Files. The files encompass various incidents, including the "Welsh Roswell" in 1974, a near-miss by a 737 plane in 1995, a "crashed UFO" investigated by a mountain rescue team in Wales in 1974, and attempted break-ins at RAF Rudloe Manor. The records also mention events like the Western Isles incident, where a loud explosion was reported in the sky. Among these files are over 5,000 pages of UFO reports, letters, drawings from the public, and parliamentary inquiries into the matter.

 Battelle Memorial Institute, a research organization, conducted the analysis. Elroy John Center, a Battelle scientist, was revealed to be a co-author of a 1949 Battelle report on analyzing memory metals, specifically Titanium alloys like Nitinol. Center had privately mentioned his involvement in analyzing UFO debris, and this revelation matched the report's findings obtained through FOIA.

Battelle is highlighted as a significant organization involved in various sectors, including defense and science. The post also notes its connections to government agencies, its status as a 501(c)(3) organization, and its control over various national laboratories. The analysis further points out connections between the report's findings and the characteristics of the Roswell crash metal, including its "shape memory" properties. General Arthur Exon's testimony and General George Schulgen's memo, along with other military studies on memory metals, are discussed as supportive evidence.

Dr. Howard C. Cross, a Battelle scientist, is identified as a key figure in UFO research for government agencies and top-secret Titanium alloy studies. The possibility of Battelle's advanced arc furnace's role in creating Nitinol memory metal is raised. The post also delves into Dr. Edgar Mitchell's statements about a "semi or quasi-private organization" involved in UFO secrecy, which the author connects to Battelle due to its characteristics and involvement in UFO-related projects. Overall, the post presents a detailed analysis of documents, reports, and statements to establish the connection between Battelle Memorial Institute and its role in analyzing materials from the Roswell UFO crash.

## 1942 - Battle of Los Angeles #news 

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BattleofLosAngeles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Los_Angeles) 

The Battle of Los Angeles occurred on February 24-25, 1942, in Los Angeles, California, during World War II. It was a purported attack on the continental U.S. by Imperial Japan, prompting a massive anti-aircraft artillery barrage. Shortly after the U.S. entered the war, the event initially raised concerns of a Japanese assault. However, Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox later dismissed it as a "false alarm." Speculation arose about a possible cover-up to hide a real invasion. In 1949, it was revealed that a meteorological balloon had triggered the incident, leading to widespread firing and panic. The U.S. Office of Air Force History attributed the event in 1983 to heightened wartime anxiety and lost weather balloons. Despite official explanations, the incident influenced air raid precautions and increased anti-aircraft defenses, while some continued to question its true cause.

[https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20797978-twining-memo](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20797978-twining-memo) 

 In a document dated September 23, 1947, the Air Materiel Command (AMC) presented its considered opinion on the phenomenon of "Flying Discs," or UFO sightings, which were a subject of intense interest at the time. The document outlined several key points, including the acknowledgment that these sightings were not considered fictitious but rather something real and not visionary. Reports described disc-shaped objects of substantial size, some displaying remarkable flight characteristics such as rapid climb rates, exceptional maneuverability, and evasive actions when encountering friendly aircraft and radar. Furthermore, the document noted common features of these objects, including metallic or reflective surfaces, circular or elliptical shapes, and the absence of trails, adding an element of mystery to the sightings. The possibility of domestic origin or the involvement of classified projects was also considered. However, the lack of physical evidence, such as crash-recovered exhibits, remained a challenge in confirming the existence and source of these objects.

The Roswell incident in June and July 1947 in New Mexico involved the military's initial announcement of recovering debris from a "flying disc," which was later retracted as a conventional weather balloon. Retired lieutenant Colonel Jesse Marcel's claims in 1978 fueled conspiracy theories that the debris was from an alien spaceship and led to government cover-up speculation. The United States Air Force's 1994 report attributed the incident to a nuclear test surveillance balloon from Project Mogul. Despite explanations, the Roswell incident remains associated with UFOs and aliens, reflecting the 1947 flying disc craze and becoming an enduring cultural symbol. The event's portrayal in media and its place in popular culture makes it a significant and long-standing UFO claim.

1\. Military put forward information that they recovered flying saucer.

2\. Then they claimed it was weather balloon.

3\. 50 years later they said that they lied to the public and that it was Mogul balloon, except that according to official documentation and testimony of Albert Crary flight no. 4 allegely responsible for Roswell incident was never launched with full equipment. 

4\. They also lied that eyewitnesses confused crashed test dummies with alien bodies, except that those dummies were used for the first time in 1950s.

5\. Dozens eyewitnesses who saw craft and pieces - Jesse Marcel, Jesse Marcel Jr, Walter Haut, Lewis Rickett, Robert Shirkey, Robert Smith, Bill Brazel Jr, George Wilcox, Frankie Rowe, Robert Slasher, Robert Porter, Edwin Easley, Steven Lovekin, June Crain, Loretta Proctor, Dean Proctor, Rolland Menagh, Richard Talbert, Earl Fulford. Most of them wrote affidavits about it.

6\. There are firsthand eyewitnesses to the bodies - Walter Haut, Eleazar Benevidez, Frederick Benthal, Philip Corso, Patrick Saunders. 

7\. People who admit to cover up - Arthur Exon, Thomas DuBose, Walter Haut, Chase Brandon.

It boggles my mind how most people never heard of any of that and instead they just accept lies and misleading statements that apparently there were only second hand stories and that everything was explained.

## 1944,  December 14 - New York Times: US Army Air Force reported they were encountering "silver colored spheres" in the air over German territory. The spheres are encountered either singly or in clusters, sometimes translucent

1813, August 27 - Extraordinary phenomena in the sun

On the morning of the 27th August, 1813, the Majestic being then off Boston, the men on board observed, at the rising of the sun, the complete figure of a man in the centre of that luminary, with a flag divided by three lines, in his hand. He was at first on his back, but as the day advanced, he gradually assumed an erect posture, and at midday stood upright. Towards evening he as gradually declined, descending with his flag head foremost. We have seen a drawing of the phenomenon, and nothing can be more correct than the human figure, its dress complete and the flag.

On the 28th, it retained the same outline, but had become a skeleton. On the 29th the figure was disjointed, and its parts gradually assumed the appearance of six separate flags, united in a circle by an apparent cord or line. After this, nothing more was observed on the sun’s disk, but a few small spots.

The American papers, we believe, notice only the extraordinary appearance of the Sun on the above mentioned days. Perhaps the observers on that continent were not in a position to catch the precise appearance which the particles of matter presented to the ship’s company of the Majestic.

There could be no optical delusion on the occasion, as the phenomenon was observed by so many different eyes, and for so long a time. The first figure was seen during the whole of the 27th, the skeleton the whole of the 28th, and the six flags during a great part of the 29th.

The above is an occurrence that may merit the attention of the philosophic. It is singular, we conceive, but nothing miraculous or portentous. Indeed, as the sun is the centre of a system of planets, several of which are much larger and probably more important than ours, we do not know why the common luminary should shape his face, or have it shaped for him, so as to indicate the particular occurrences on this earth.

The sun is, no doubt, a material luminous body—perhaps liable to an internal irregular motion of tis parts; at least, this phenomenon would seem to prove it so; and most people have observed how frequently the ignited cinders of a common fire present, at different times, the various appearances of men, trees, horses, houses &c.,

The evidence, however, for the phenomenon itself, we must again add, is of the most undoubted and respectable kind. We have seen, and have by us, copies of drawings made by Captain Hayes on the occasion.

On December 13th, at Supreme Headquarters, Allied Expeditionary Force, a startling revelation emerged regarding a novel German weapon on the western air front. American Air Force pilots reported their encounters with enigmatic silver spheres hovering over German territory. These spheres appeared either as solitary orbs or in mysterious clusters, occasionally displaying a semi-translucent quality. This astonishing development, dubbed a "secret" weapon, coincided curiously with the Christmas season, resembling the festive glass balls adorning Christmas trees. However, the true nature of these enigmatic spheres remained uncertain, as there was no available information regarding how they remained suspended in the sky, what they contained, or the purpose they were intended to serve. The floating mystery ball had become a perplexing and mystifying addition to the unfolding wartime narrative.

John Lear's UFO hypothesis, detailed in the file UFO 1953, discusses extensive government cover-ups and contact with extraterrestrial beings. Lear, a pilot with a CIA and government background, asserts that the truth about alien interaction has been suppressed for about two decades, causing upheaval. He proposes that Germany may have recovered a saucer in 1939 and describes aliens resembling praying mantises, much more advanced than humans. Some witnesses to the "truth" met mysterious deaths. The MJ-12, a top military scientist group, handles UFO matters involving saucer crashes like Roswell. Lear alleges a communication with aliens at Holloman Air Force Base in 1964 and a technology-for-silence deal in 1969-1971. He claims abductions involve brain implants and genetic experiments, suggesting aliens rely on human and animal tissues for survival, leading to cattle mutilations. Lear states MJ-12 planned gradual disclosure to the public, potentially involving UFO researcher William Moore. He implies extraterrestrial existence is hidden via media manipulation, raising questions about alien infiltration or invasion.
