## 1968, April 2 - Our Lady of Zeitoun: Marian Apparitions Above Coptic Church in Egypt #ReligiousCultural #CivilianSightings #MultipleWitness #PhotoEvidence #HistoricalPreModern #Africa

First reported on April 2, 1968, luminous apparitions interpreted as the Virgin Mary appeared above the Coptic Orthodox Church of Saint Mary in Zeitoun, Cairo, Egypt. The phenomena continued intermittently until 1971 and were witnessed by thousands of people, including Coptic Orthodox and Catholic Christians, Muslims, Jews, foreign diplomats, journalists, skeptics, and scientists. Witnesses reported seeing a luminous female figure, sometimes accompanied by lights in the shape of doves, intense flashes, or glowing halos moving over the church. The Coptic Orthodox Church officially recognized the apparitions on May 4, 1968, under Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria. Estimates suggest 250,000 to millions witnessed the events over three years. The case remains one of the most documented mass sighting events of the 20th century, with photographic evidence and cross-religious witness testimony.

The United States Air Force officially terminated Project Blue Book on December 17, 1969, following the conclusions of the Condon Report (Scientific Study of Unidentified Flying Objects) released in January 1969. The Condon Committee, led by physicist Edward Condon at the University of Colorado, concluded that further study of UFOs could not be justified on scientific grounds. The report stated that "nothing has come from the study of UFOs in the past 21 years that has added to scientific knowledge" and recommended discontinuation of Air Force UFO investigations. This decision established the institutional posture toward UAP that persisted for decades, with official government interest appearing to cease until the 2000s. The Condon Report has been criticized for potential bias, with some committee members alleging the conclusion was predetermined. Project Blue Book investigated 12,618 UFO reports from 1952-1969, with 701 cases remaining "unidentified."

**Event Type**: Program_Termination, Scientific_Report, Policy_Decision
**Credibility**: 5/5 (Official Air Force program, peer-reviewed study, government records)
**Related Events**: Ends Project Blue Book (1952-1969); influences decades of official UAP policy; cited in later congressional discussions
**Causal Impact**: Established 50+ year institutional skepticism; created information vacuum filled by civilian researchers; contributed to stigma around UAP reporting
