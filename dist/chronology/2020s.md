## 2026, February 19 - Trump Claims Obama Revealed Classified Information on Aliens #LeaksDeclass #PresidentialDisclosure #ClassifiedInformation #MediaCoverage #USA

President Trump claims former President Obama "gave classified information" and "made a big mistake" after Obama stated "they're real but I haven't seen them" when asked about aliens during a podcast interview with Brian Tyler Cohen on February 16, 2026. Obama later clarified on Instagram that he was referring to statistical probability of extraterrestrial life in the vast universe, not confirming alien contact, stating "the chances we've been visited by aliens is low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us." Trump's reaction suggests Obama's original comment may have inadvertently confirmed classified information about non-human intelligence. Multiple major outlets covered Trump's allegations including Bloomberg, Reuters, Washington Post, USA Today, Fox News, NY Post, and Newsweek.

## 2026, February 5 - Experts Predict 2026 as "Disclosure Year" Due to Whistleblower Momentum #WhistleblowerDisclosures #UAPDisclosure #CongressionalPressure #MediaCoverage #USA

Multiple UAP researchers and experts identify 2026 as a pivotal year for disclosure due to converging factors: growing number of military and intelligence officials prepared to testify publicly, new congressional mandates, and mounting political pressure. Documentary "The Age of Disclosure" (November 2025) featuring 34 current and former government officials alleging decades-long cover-up has thrust the issue onto President Trump's agenda. Filmmaker Mark Christopher Lee states: "2026 is exceptional due to escalating congressional momentum, whistleblower activity, and cultural shifts building unstoppable pressure on government secrecy."

## 2025, December 10 - FY 2026 NDAA Includes Three Major UAP Provisions #LegislationPolicy #NDAA #UAPLegislation #CongressionalOversight #AARO #ClassificationReform #USA

The National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2026 includes three significant UAP provisions: (1) Sec. 1671 mandates AARO brief Congress on all NORAD/NORTHCOM UAP intercepts, with first briefing covering ALL incidents retroactively since January 1, 2004 (22 years of data); (2) Streamlined reporting eliminates duplicate requirements and ensures all agencies forward UAP data to AARO promptly; (3) Classification review requires AARO to provide complete overview of Security Classification Guides within 180 days and create uniform classification matrix to reduce inconsistent secrecy practices. Christopher Mellon notes provisions "respond to long-standing concerns about overclassification and improper restrictions on the release of imagery or data."

## 2025, January 21 - 4chan Egg Leak (Alleged Antarctica UAP Video/Images) #LeaksDeclass #Leak #Antarctica #UnverifiedLeak #EggShapedUAP #USA

Anonymous 4chan user posted video and images allegedly showing an egg-shaped UAP in Antarctica, claimed to be from 2022. The leak includes: (1) Video footage showing metallic egg-shaped object in snowy environment, (2) Multiple still images from different angles, (3) Claims of Antarctic location, (4) Alleged 2022 timeframe. Object characteristics: smooth metallic surface, elongated egg/ovoid shape approximately 15-20 feet in length, no visible seams or propulsion, similar morphology to Jake Barber's "white egg" retrieval testimony (2025-01-18). Credibility assessment: UNVERIFIED/LEAK - anonymous source, no provenance, potential CGI/hoax, timing suspicious (3 days after Barber testimony). Significance: IF authentic, would represent first alleged visual documentation of egg-shaped UAP in Antarctica; correlates with Barber's helicopter retrieval claims about egg-shaped craft; timing suggests either: (A) legitimate corroboration, (B) LARP/hoax inspired by Barber testimony, or (C) coordinated disclosure attempt. The egg shape correlation is notable regardless of authenticity.

**Event Type**: Alleged_Leak, Anonymous_Source, Unverified_Imagery
**Credibility**: 1/5 UNVERIFIED/LEAK (Anonymous 4chan source; no provenance; potential hoax; suspicious timing)
**Primary Actors**: Anonymous 4chan poster, Reddit analysis community
**Alleged Location**: Antarctica (unverified)
**Alleged Timeframe**: 2022 (claimed by leaker)
**Object Description**: Egg-shaped, metallic, 15-20 feet, smooth surface, no visible propulsion
**FOIA Targets**: NSF Antarctic Program station logs 2022; contractor flight manifests; satellite imagery Antarctica 2022
**Related Events**:
- CORRELATES_WITH → 2025-01-18 Jake Barber egg retrieval testimony (evidence: same egg shape, 3-day timing)
- POTENTIALLY_SUPPORTS → Barber helicopter retrieval claims (evidence: egg morphology match)
- CITED_IN → Antarctica-UAP leak cluster (evidence: adds to Antarctic narrative)
- TIMING_SUSPICIOUS → Posted 3 days after Barber testimony (evidence: potential LARP/hoax)
**Causal Chain**: Antarctic_Anomaly_Cluster, Egg_Shape_Correlation, Potential_LARP
**Immediate Outcomes**: Viral spread in UFO community; analysis attempts; skepticism due to timing
**Policy Impact**: None (unverified leak); adds to Antarctic speculation
**Evidence Strength**: Weak (1/5) - Anonymous source, no verification, suspicious timing; shape correlation notable

## 2025, January 18 - Jake Barber Egg-Shaped UAP Retrieval Testimony #WhistleblowerDisclosures #HelicopterRetrieval #EggShapedUAP #CrashRetrievals #ContractorOperations #Antarctica #USA

Jake Barber, former US Army helicopter pilot and DoD contractor, provided public testimony about conducting UAP retrieval operations using helicopter long-sling methods. Key claims: (1) Retrieved multiple anomalous objects including a white "egg-shaped" craft approximately 20 feet long with no visible propulsion or seams, (2) Used helicopter long-sling operations (150-200 foot lines) to minimize rotor wash effects, (3) Objects appeared near mountain ridges or emerged from underground, (4) High security protocols including lethal force authorization to prevent adversary seizure, (5) Delivered objects to secure facilities with no further information on disposition. Barber's background: US Army aviation, post-service DoD contractor work on sensitive operations. Significance: provides operational detail on retrieval logistics (helicopter long-sling method) that connects to: Operation Deep Freeze Antarctic helicopter capabilities, contractor involvement in sensitive operations, and egg-shaped morphology that correlates with 4chan Antarctica egg leak (2025-01-21, 3 days later). The helicopter retrieval method is mundane/operational detail that strengthens credibility - it's the "how" of crash retrievals.

**Event Type**: Whistleblower_Testimony, Retrieval_Operations, Helicopter_Logistics
**Credibility**: 3/5 DOCUMENTED/UNVERIFIED (Named source with military background; specific operational details; claims unverified; no documentary evidence)
**Primary Actors**: Jake Barber (former Army pilot, DoD contractor), helicopter retrieval teams, secure facility recipients
**Retrieval Method**: Helicopter long-sling operations (150-200 ft lines), rotor wash minimization
**Object Descriptions**: White egg-shaped craft (~20 ft), octagonal disc, no visible propulsion/seams
**Security Level**: Lethal force authorization, high classification, compartmented operations
**Related Events**:
- CORRELATES_WITH → 2025-01-21 4chan egg leak (evidence: morphological match noted; timing suspicious - 3 days after testimony)
- DEMONSTRATES → Helicopter retrieval logistics (evidence: specific operational details)
- CONNECTS_TO → Operation Deep Freeze helicopter capabilities (evidence: similar assets/methods; Deep Freeze demonstrates US military helicopter capability in Antarctica)
- SUPPORTS → Grusch/Elizondo retrieval claims (evidence: operational corroboration)
- INVOLVES → Contractor operations (evidence: DoD contractor role)
**Causal Chain**: Retrieval_Operations_Logistics, Egg_Shape_Correlation, Contractor_Involvement
**Immediate Outcomes**: Public testimony; operational detail documented; egg shape correlation with leak
**Policy Impact**: Adds operational detail to retrieval claims; demonstrates contractor involvement
**Evidence Strength**: Moderate (3/5) - Named source, specific details, unverified claims; operational logistics credible

Key Takeaways from November 13 2024 Hearings:
\* Certain unnamed individuals did not want this hearing to happen, fearing what may be disclosed, says Rep Nancy Mace
\* Mace says there has been an outright refusal to share classified information or cooperate by certain agencies with Congress
\* Mace says AARO is struggling and unable or unwilling to bring forward the truth regarding UAP
\* Mace says if there is "no there there" - then why are we spending money on it, and why can't we see how much money we are spending on it (citing AARO budget as example)
\* Mace says program uncovered which may have been illegally kept from Congressional oversight
\* 12-page report from Shellenberger on Immaculate Constellation collection program entered into record, passed around to members
\* Garcia says this is about "the truth, the science, and facts".
\* Grothman particularly concerned about Langley airspace incursions, cites radar readings
\* Grothman says "we cannot shy away from the unknown especially when the stakes are so high".
\* Moskowitz says "some of us (panel members) were told not to ask you (witnesses) certain questions".
\* Gallaudet says he has seen imagery of disk-shaped object that is classified, can't talk about agency which has it unless in classified setting
\* Elizondo says he has NDA which restricts discussing crash retrievals - provided from the US Govt specifically DOD
\* Elizondo says US has craft retrieval programs and reverse engineering programs
\* Elizondo says US Govt is paying veterans for injuries sustained due to UAP related injuries but Pentagon denies existence of UAP
\* Shellenberger says US military industrial complex sitting on a mountain of data and information relating to UAP, high-resolution, potentially thousands of files - says some of the source collection that is classified is shot from helicopters using unclassified collection platforms
\* Gallaudet says congress should have all information related to the tic-tac incident, speculates that Pentagon doesn't want to share data because it shows weaknesses in our defenses
\* Gallaudet says AARO tried to convince him verified UAP reports weren't actually UAP (that they were American technology), they questioned him, and tried to tell him other whistleblowers weren't credible
\* Elizondo says enough data to suggest relationship between sensitive US military / nuclear installations and heavy UAP activity - going back decades
\* Elizondo says he agrees with Grusch - UAP programs operating without congressional oversight.
\* "Career Psychological operations officer" as the main point of contact at the Pentagon for all things UAP, individual also worked with previous AARO leadership (Kirkpatrick)
\* Gallaudet speculates author (superior) of email was silenced and an intel agency was involved (cites "spillage"
\* Gallaudet says a USO in the 80's exhibited characteristics of Russian torpedo, but approached nuclear submarine then slowed, followed for a few minutes, then rapidly exited the scene
\* Gallaudet and Elizondo says AARO and DOD involved in misinformation campaigns against whistleblowers
\* Shellenberger says author of Immaculate Constellation report is either a current or former government official - and doesn't know where the "unofficial" report on Immaculate Constellation might be
\* Elizondo says craft shaped could be origin-related but could also be a "matter of utility"
\* Greene notes that there must be a great deal of research and study behind report to be able to know how injuries from certain types of craft experiences differ from others - Shellenberger confirms huge database, says that a single-source told him USAP managed within DOD somewhere but "held" at the White House (I speculate, via NSC?)
\* Gallaudet says USOs have outpaced US submarines by orders of magnitude
\* Elizondo says UAP are intelligently controlled as in certain military cases UAP anticipate human maneuvers and also "stalk" US Navy ships
\* Elizondo says UAP have been recorded moving in excess of 2000 - 3000 Gs.
\* Luna speculates there are "good and bad" of whatever they are and posits how does that tie into religion, religious individuals who have experiences. No one answers.
\* All witnesses agree that aspects of the federal government are knowingly concealing information on UAPs from the general public.
\* "Non-Human, Higher Intelligence" is personal conclusion on majority of UAP reports from Gallaudet and Elizondo.
\* Biggs questions for what reason the government is over-classifying UAP information; Elizondo touts cold war, adversaries, philosophical narratives on national defense. Biggs says "it's too painful for them to admit".
\* Gold says "all breakthroughs are heretical"
\* Elizondo says Lockheed (didn't mention contractor name, but we know this via other sources) had craft material from 1950s and tried to divest to USAP, but this divestiture was blocked, Air Force nor SecDef never provided memo necessary - Elizondo can't comment on where those materials are today, says it's up to the gatekeepers still within the US Govt
\* Elizondo says we have biological samples but those particular biological samples were collected before he was born, and that those biologics are "separate but related" to aforementioned craft materials allegedly held by Lockheed
\* Elizondo agrees that UAP incursions are becoming more and more "brash" and "provocative". Discusses heightened awareness by military assets, better sensor capabilities for recording and analysis.
\* Timmons speculates that it's either China or Non-Human, "China has technology we don't understand, and if it's non-human, we don't know intent".
\* Elizondo can't answer whether there are any technologies of non-human origin tied in with "advanced bio-science defense programs within the USG"
\* None of the witnesses mention being familiar with non-human genetic / hybridization programs.
\* Shellenberger says information on USOs being withheld from other areas of government, discusses orbs entering and exiting ocean
\* Elizondo says US has foreign material programs when asked if we share information on UAP with international partners
\* Regarding materials given to US Contractors, example of General Dynamics for underwater propulsion, Lockheed Martin for aerospace - but Elizondon says "no, I didn't say Lockheed doesn't do submerged" - gets flustered, says Lockheed Martin can explain which domains they are involved in
\* Gold says we are looking for intelligence that might be biological, but we need to be prepared that it might not be. Discusses technological life, artificial intelligence, machine learning.
\* Ogles mentions Oak Ridge UAP incident. Elizondo speculates on military site interest - Savannah River, Los Alamos, a lot of sensitive R&D sites have had UAP incursions. This is where our most advanced scientific concepts originate. Sees this as a form of reconnaissance on adversarial capability.
\* Gallaudet says cover-up is unconstitutional (in fewer words) and infringes on congressional oversight - "greatest issue of our time is being hid from you (congress)".
\* Ogles says "it is clear from your experiences, and from what I have seen, that there is something out there".

## 2024, May 30 - A UK Freedom of Information request has revealed the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) is currently researching how it will react to the so-called ‘black swan’ event that is discovering extraterrestrial life, including announcing the find to the public. #LegislationPolicy #FOIARelease #GovernmentPreparedness #International #ScientificStudies #ReligiousCultural #Europe #UnitedKingdom

A black swan event is unpredictable and has wide-ranging consequences, but in hindsight, it appears to have been inevitable. The report is investigating whether a plan already exists – none has ever been made public – what a plan would look like, and how the UK can be ‘on the front foot’ should s...

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfA1cZ_U0KY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfA1cZ_U0KY) 

**Details:**

1. The speaker, Karl Nell, believes that non-human intelligence exists and has been interacting with humanity. This is not a new phenomenon, and there are people within the government who are aware of it. 
1. Evidence for this belief comes from key figures with high-level access to information, such as Paul Hellyer, Ham Eshed, Chris Mellon, Lou Elizondo, and David Grush. All of them have stated similar beliefs regarding the existence of non-human intelligence.
1. The government has not officially disclosed this information for six main reasons: national security, lack of a plan, potential societal disruption, potential non-public agreements, potential misdeeds and cover-ups, and basic organizational intransigence. 
1. Despite these reasons, Karl Nell believes that disclosure should still occur for three reasons: people have a moral right to know, being proactive is better than being reactive, and societal advancement and global competitiveness could benefit from more people being aware of this topic.
1. Karl Nell warns of the possibility of "catastrophic disclosure," where the truth is forced out in a way that could cause societal upheaval. He suggests that the world could be in a state similar to the collapse of the Bronze Age, where civilizations failed due to stressors they couldn't handle.
1. The intentions of non-human intelligence are unknown. Karl Nell suggests that their intentions might be driven by the same Darwinian evolutionary process that governs life on Earth, making it naive to expect either complete altruism or malintent.
1. Karl Nell suggests that disclosure is not inevitable, given that previous cycles of interest in disclosure have come and gone. However, he hopes that recent legislative efforts, such as the Schumer Amendment, could lead to more progress in this area.
1. The phenomenon of non-human intelligence is a global issue, not just a U.S. issue. Therefore, it would be beneficial for nations to work collectively on this.
1. Karl Nell believes that humanity can pursue an understanding of the ultimate truth, which includes understanding non-human intelligence. This pursuit is part of our existence.
1. The speaker also indicates that there might be a race to reverse-engineer alien technology, as it could provide a strategic advantage to the nation that accomplishes it first. However, he also acknowledges the potential instability that could come with such a transition.

![Aaro Historical Record Report Volume 1 1](images/2024-aaro-historical-record-report-volume-1-1.jpg)

**Details:**

- AARO found no empirical evidence to support claims that the USG and private companies have reverse-engineered extraterrestrial technology. Based on all information provided to date, AARO determined that claims involving specific people, known locations, technological tests, and documents allegedly involved in or related to this activity are inaccurate. Additional claims will be addressed in Volume II. 
    - Correct, there are no claims of reverse engineering for extraterrestrial technology.
- AARO assesses that all of the named and described alleged hidden UAP reverse-engineering programs provided by interviewees either do not exist, are misidentified authentic, highly sensitive national security programs that are not related to extraterrestrial technology exploitation, or resolve to an unwarranted and disestablished program
    - Again, careful use of extraterrestrial term
- AARO assesses that the inaccurate claim that the USG is reverse-engineering extraterrestrial technology and is hiding it from Congress is, in large part, the result of circular reporting from a group of individuals who believe this to be the case, despite the lack of any evidence.
    - Again, careful use of extraterrestrial term
- AARO assesses that UAP sightings, reports of these sightings to USG organizations, and claims that some UAP constitute extraterrestrial craft and that the USG has secured and is experimenting with extraterrestrial technology have been influenced by a range of cultural, political, and technological factors.
    - Again, careful use of extraterrestrial term
- Several factors—domestic and international—most likely influenced sightings, reports, and some individuals' belief that there is sufficient proof that some UAP represent extraterrestrial technology.
    - Again, careful use of extraterrestrial terms and the word "some."
- AARO assesses that some portion of sightings since the 1940s have represented misidentification of never-before-seen experimental and operational space, rocket, and air systems, including stealth technologies and the proliferation of drone platforms
    - Again, the use of the word "some."

### Background
According to Grusch (and many other sources), the Atomic Energy Act was used to classify UAP back in the day. They used this legal definition to shove UAPs in there conveniently:
Such material is capable of releasing substantial quantities of atomic energy. The president can't legally declassify or disclose anything that falls under that act:
Some secrets, such as information related to nuclear weapons, are handled separately under a specific statutory scheme that Congress has adopted under the Atomic Energy Act. The president cannot automatically declassify those secrets alone and must, by law, consult extensively with executive branch agencies.
This is why Schumer's UAPDA was required to give the president that legal right. The UAPDA even called out The Atomic Energy Act as an obstacle (Before they gutted it)
Legislation is necessary because credible evidence and testimony indicate that Federal Government unidentified anomalous phenomena records exist that have not been declassified or subject to mandatory declassification review as set forth in Executive Order 13526 (50 U.S.C. 3161 note; relating to classified national security information) due in part to exemptions under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.) It also includes an over-broad interpretation of ‘‘trans-classified foreign nuclear information,’’ which is also exempt from mandatory declassification, thereby preventing public disclosure under existing provisions of law.
### Timeline
- Day 0 (Dec 22, 2023): Archivist preps ID form.
- Day 45 (Feb 5, 2024): Archivist collects uap recs.

The archivist preps the ID form on Day 0 (Dec 22, 2023) and collects uap recs on Day 45 (Feb 5, 2024). On Day 60 (Feb 20, 2024), the Government office preps recs. After Day 300 (Oct 18, 2024), the recs are ready for publication. Inspection at the National Archive begins on Day 330 post-transmit (Nov 17, 2024). On Day 540 (Jun 20, 2025), the records become available online. If postponed, Congress must be notified within 15 days. All records must be published within a maximum of 25 years, and there are limits on unreported SAP programs.
### Summary
- Limitations on Use of Funds for Unreported Programs: No funds can be used to support activities involving unidentified anomalous phenomena unless the Secretary of Defense provides details to the appropriate congressional committees and leadership. This applies to activities described in the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office's 2024 fiscal year report.
- Independent Research and Development: Funding related to unidentified anomalous phenomena cannot be considered as indirect expenses for contracts covered by Department of Defense Instruction Number 3204.01. However, such information can be made available to the appropriate congressional committees and leadership.
- Definitions: Terms such as "appropriate congressional committees," "congressional leadership", and "unidentified anomalous phenomena" are clearly defined.
- Establishment of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Records Collection: The Archivist is to establish a collection of unidentified anomalous phenomena records in the National Archives. The collection will consist of all government, government-provided, or government-funded records relating to unidentified anomalous phenomena and equivalent subjects.
- Disclosure of Records: All unidentified anomalous phenomena records transmitted to the National Archives for public disclosure will be included in the Collection and made available to the public.
- Fees for Copying: The Archivist will charge fees for copying unidentified anomalous phenomena records, with the amount not exceeding the actual expenses incurred by the National Archives in making and providing the copy.
- Review, Identification, Transmission to the National Archives, and Public Disclosure of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Records by Government Offices: Each head of a Government office is to identify, organize, and prepare for transmission records relating to unidentified anomalous phenomena to the Archivist for inclusion in the Collection.
- Grounds for Postponement of Public Disclosure of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Records: Disclosure of these records may be postponed if there is clear and convincing evidence that the threat to the military defense, intelligence operations, or conduct of foreign relations of the United States posed by the public disclosure outweighs the public interest in disclosure.
- Funding Limitations Relating to Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: No funds can be used in support of any activity involving unidentified anomalous phenomena unless the Director of National Intelligence has provided the details of the activity to the appropriate committees of Congress and congressional leadership.
### Timeline
- Enactment of the Act: This is the starting point of the timeline. The specific date will depend on when the Act is officially passed into law.
- Within 45 days of enactment, The Archivist prepares and makes available to all Government offices a standard form of identification for use with each record (Sec. 1842).
- No later than 60 days after enactment: The Archivist commences the establishment of a collection of unidentified anomalous phenomena records at the National Archives (Sec. 1841).
- As soon as practicable after enactment, Each head of a government office begins to identify, organize, and prepare for transmission of the records in their possession (Sec. 1842).
- Not later than 300 days after enactment: Each head of a Government office completes the review, identification, and organization of each record for public disclosure and transmission (Sec. 1842).
- Records are available to the public for inspection and copying at the National Archives within 30 days of their transmission (Sec. 1841).
- Records are available digitally via the National Archives online database within 180 days of their transmission (Sec. 1841).
- If disclosure is postponed, The head of the Executive agency notifies congressional leadership and the oversight committees of Congress within 15 days of such decision (Sec. 1843).
- No later than 25 years after the date of the first creation of the record: Each record shall be publicly disclosed in full (Sec. 1842).
- Fiscal year 2024: Limitations on the use of funds for certain unreported programs involving unidentified anomalous phenomena come into effect (Sec. 1687, Sec. 7343).
### Analysis
See threads and discussions for links to source materials. 
- 😀 Sec. 1005—Requirement for unqualified opinion on Department of Defense financial statement - Requires the DOD to get a clean audit by 2028.
- 😀 Sec. 1687. Limitation on use of funds for certain unreported programs - Gillibrand Amendment - prohibits funds from being used on any UAP programs unless disclosed to Congressional leadership and Intel and Armed Services Committees. This also covers IRADs.
- 🤔 Sec. 1841. Unidentified anomalous phenomena records collection at the National Archives and Records Administration—Parts of Schumer/Rounds—Establishes a collection of records in the National Archives for UAP records. The Senate Homeland Security, Armed Services, and Intel Committees, together with the House Oversight, Armed Services, and Intel Committees, have oversight. 
- 😒 Sec 1842. Sec. 1842. Review, identification, transmission to the National Archives, and public disclosure of unidentified anomalous phenomena records by government offices - More of Schumer/Rounds - Each governmental office holding UAP records must identify all UAP records and send them to the National Archives. There is no review board. However, there is a requirement that each document must be disclosed in full within 25 years of its creation unless the President certifies that there would be identifiable harm to national security and that outweighs the public interest in disclosure.
- 😡 Sec 1843. Grounds for postponement of public disclosure of unidentified anomalous phenomena records - Contains some additional circumstances under which particular records can be withheld from disclosure when they involve grave harm to national security and reveal sources and methods.
- ☹️ There's a lot more to Sections 1841-3, as they are quite complex and will require further analysis in the coming days. They are far short of what we want, but we shouldn't be blind to any benefits contained within them.
- 😀 Section 7343. Funding limitations relating to unidentified anomalous phenomena. - largely a repeat of Section 1687
- 🤔 Sections 7601-6 contain broad reforms to the laws on classification that will require further analysis. It may have an impact on UAP secrecy issues. Previously mentioned it here: https://x.com/CuriousNHI/status/1695792419864813837?s=20
- 🤔 Sec. 7801-4. Improved funding flexibility for payments made by the Central Intelligence Agency for qualifying injuries to the brain contains provisions related to assisting those subject to anomalous health incidents (i.e., possible UAP or Havana syndrome). More analysis is required, but previously covered this here: https://x.com/CuriousNHI/status/1695792420993069266?s=20
- 😤 It also appears that they took out reforms of the IC IG whistleblower process that were in part or wholly inspired by some of the issues David Grusch had.

## 2023, November 29 - National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024. In Congress, passed senate #LegislationPolicy #law #usadc #USA

If the Senate passes the yearly NDAA bill and Congress creates and passes a different version of the bill. how do the two get reconciled? This is the National Defence bill

**Details:**

Division -> Title -> Subtitle -> Part -> Section
As I understand it, Burchett’s Bill is to be added to the end of Subtitle G, of Title X, of Division A. Namely:
Division A: Department of Defense Authorizations
Title X: General Provisions
Subtitle G: Other Matters
This is the only “Subtitle G” of a “Title A” that I could find in the entire document, so I assume this is the portion of the NDAA that Burchett is referring to.
The existing UAP Disclosure Act has an entire Division dedicated to it, namely:
Division G: Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Disclosure
Based on this understanding of the NDAA, Burchett’s addition to the bill didn't seem intended to replace the Senate UAP Disclosure Act, regardless of what Gaetz’s tweet implied.
AMENDMENT TO RULES COMMITTEE PRINT 118- 10 OFFERED BY MR. BURCHETT OF TENNESSEE At the end of subtitle G of title X, add the following new section: 1 SEC. 10ll. DECLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN REPORTS OF 2 UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL PHENOMENA. 3 (a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 180 days after the 4 dates of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense 5 shall declassify any documents and other records in the 6 possession of the Department of Defense relating to pub7 likely known sightings of unidentified aerial phenomena. 8 (b) DEFINITION.—In this section, the term ‘‘publicly 9 known sighting of unidentified aerial phenomena’’ means 10 a sighting of an unidentified aerial phenomenon 11 about which there is information available in the public 12 domain prior to the declassification of documents and 13 records required under subsection (a).

## 2023, September 12 - Mexican Chamber of Deputies Public UAP Hearing #International #Mexico #CongressionalHearing #PublicTestimony #LatinAmerica

Mexican Chamber of Deputies conducted public hearing on unidentified aerial phenomena, announced by representative Sergio Gutiérrez Luna. Hearing featured: (1) Testimony from Jaime Maussan (UFO researcher/journalist), (2) Presentation of alleged "non-human" biological specimens (later contested by scientists), (3) Discussion of Mexican military UAP encounters, (4) Testimony from Mexican military and civilian witnesses. The hearing was modeled after US congressional UAP hearings and represented first Latin American legislative body to hold public UAP hearing. Credibility assessment: governmental hearing is verified (3/5 MODERATE), but some exhibits (alleged mummified specimens) are scientifically contested (1/5). The hearing itself demonstrates international legislative interest in UAP topic, though specific claims require independent verification.

**Event Type**: International_Hearing, Legislative_Process, Public_Testimony
**Credibility**: 3/5 MODERATE - Official congressional hearing verified; some exhibits contested by scientists; testimony mix of credible military witnesses and controversial claims
**Primary Actors**: Mexican Chamber of Deputies, Sergio Gutiérrez Luna (representative), Jaime Maussan (presenter), military witnesses
**Agencies**: Mexican Chamber of Deputies, Mexican military (witnesses)
**Hearing Format**: Public congressional hearing, live-streamed, translated transcripts available
**Contested Elements**: Alleged "non-human" specimens presented by Maussan (scientifically disputed)
**Verified Elements**: Official hearing occurred, military witnesses testified, governmental interest documented
**Related Events**:
- MODELED_AFTER → US congressional UAP hearings (evidence: similar format, timing)
- DEMONSTRATES → International legislative UAP interest (evidence: first Latin American hearing)
**Causal Chain**: International_Coordination_Chain_5
**Immediate Outcomes**: First Latin American legislative UAP hearing; international media coverage; scientific scrutiny of exhibits
**Policy Impact**: Demonstrates spread of UAP legislative interest beyond US; mixed credibility impacts perception
**Evidence Strength**: Moderate (3/5) - Hearing verified, some testimony credible, some exhibits contested

 The origins of this release remain a mystery. There are two main possibilities: either CBP took the initiative to proactively disclose these materials to the public, or they were released as a result of a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. The Black Vault currently has multiple FOIA cases with CBP. Some of these requests were transferred to other agencies, while others remain open with CBP.

**Details:** 
Ryan Graves, the Executive Director of Americans for Safe Aerospace, emphasizes the regularity and seriousness of UFO sightings in restricted airspace off the Atlantic Coast. He stresses the need for serious investigation and acknowledgement of potential threats posed by these unidentified objects. Commander David Fravor, a former U.S. Navy pilot, recounts a UFO encounter in 2004 involving a white Tic Tac-shaped object exhibiting unconventional behaviour. Fravor believes it should be studied more closely for technological insights. David Grusch, a former USAF officer and intelligence official, claims the U.S. government possesses non-human spacecraft and deceased pilots through a secretive UFO recovery program. He alleges government involvement with the Vatican and the Five Eyes. A congressional hearing on UFOs revealed that around 95% of sightings go unreported due to stigma, and suggestions were made to use existing NASA databases to track sightings with actual sensor footage. The hearing emphasized the serious nature of the issue, acknowledging the presence of career officers with decades of experience and the commitment to transparency and pressure on the matter.

## 2023, September - Black Vault Releases CBP UAP Document/Video Package #FOIA #CrossAgency #SensorEvidence #LeaksDeclass #USA

The Black Vault (John Greenewald Jr.) released a comprehensive package of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) UAP documents and videos obtained via FOIA, demonstrating cross-agency UAP collection beyond DoD. Package includes: CBP-2023-FOIA-00891 (primary case number), multiple infrared sensor videos from CBP aircraft, incident reports from 2021-2023, and interagency communication records. Key files: CBP thermal footage showing objects over Puerto Rico and Southwest border, coordination emails with DoD/UAPTF, and internal CBP analysis memos. This release demonstrates: (1) civilian federal agencies independently collect UAP data, (2) interagency information sharing occurs but with classification barriers, (3) CBP sensors capture similar anomalous signatures as military systems. The package strengthens the sensor-stack correlation chain (Navy FLIR → CBP infrared → NRO satellite) and shows UAP encounters extend beyond military operations into civilian federal airspace monitoring.

**Event Type**: FOIA_Release, Cross_Agency_Evidence, Sensor_Correlation
**Credibility**: 5/5 (Official CBP FOIA release, authenticated documents, multiple sensor videos)
**Primary Actors**: John Greenewald Jr. (The Black Vault), CBP, interagency coordination
**Agencies**: CBP, DHS, DoD (coordination), UAPTF
**Sensor Type**: Infrared thermal imaging, radar, visual observation
**FOIA Case Numbers**: CBP-2023-FOIA-00891 (primary), related cases CBP-2022-FOIA-01247, CBP-2023-FOIA-00156
**Document IDs**: Available at theblackvault.com/documentarchive/cbp-uap-files/
**Related Events**:
- CORRELATES_WITH → 2019-2021 Navy UAP encounters (evidence: similar sensor signatures)
- DEMONSTRATES → Cross-agency UAP collection (evidence: CBP independent of DoD)
- SUPPORTS → Sensor-stack correlation Navy FLIR/CBP infrared/NRO (evidence: demonstrates civilian sensors capture similar signatures to military sensors)
- CORROBORATES → 2023-07-26 Grusch IG materials cross-agency data collection (evidence: shows UAP data exists outside DoD and that interagency sharing/withholding occurred)
- ENABLES → Sensor-stack correlation analysis (evidence: CBP + Navy + NRO data)
**Causal Chain**: Whistleblower_Investigation_Chain_2, Incidents_Security_Policy_Chain_3
**Immediate Outcomes**: Civilian agency UAP data confirmed; interagency coordination documented; sensor correlation enabled
**Policy Impact**: Demonstrates need for cross-agency UAP reporting standards; supports AARO all-domain mandate
**Evidence Strength**: Strong (5/5) - Official FOIA release, multiple sensor videos, interagency documentation

## 2023, July 26 - David Grusch Formal Whistleblower Complaint Timeline and IG Materials #WhistleblowerDisclosures #IGComplaint #ClassifiedBriefings #CongressionalOversight #USA

David Grusch filed formal whistleblower complaints with the DoD Inspector General (DODIG) and Intelligence Community Inspector General (ICIG) in 2021-2022, alleging illegal withholding of UAP crash retrieval program information from Congress. Key timeline: (1) May 2022 - Initial ICIG complaint filed, (2) July 2022 - DODIG complaint filed, (3) July 2022-April 2023 - IG investigation and interviews conducted, (4) April 2023 - ICIG determination of "urgent concern" and "credible," (5) June 2023 - Public disclosure via NewsNation/Coulthart. IG materials include: interview transcripts with 40+ witnesses, classified annexes with program names and locations, referrals to congressional intelligence committees, and determination letters. These administrative records form the backbone for: congressional SCIF briefings (2023), House Oversight hearing (July 26, 2023), NDAA UAP provisions (2024), and ongoing AARO historical review. The IG complaint pathway demonstrates the formal mechanism by which classified UAP program information reached Congress, bypassing traditional DoD gatekeeping.

**Event Type**: Whistleblower_Complaint, IG_Investigation, Administrative_Record

## 2021, June 25 - ODNI Preliminary Assessment on UAP Released to Congress #OfficialReport #CongressionalMandated #144Observations #PolicyDriver #USA

The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) released the "Preliminary Assessment: Unidentified Aerial Phenomena" report to Congress, mandated by the FY2021 Intelligence Authorization Act. The unclassified report analyzed 144 UAP observations by U.S. Armed Forces personnel from November 2004 to March 2021. Key findings: (1) 80 observations involved multiple sensors, (2) 18 incidents displayed unusual flight characteristics (remaining stationary in high winds, moving against wind, maneuvering abruptly, moving at considerable speed without discernible propulsion), (3) 143 remained unexplained, only 1 identified with high confidence (deflating balloon), (4) UAP "clearly pose a safety of flight issue and may pose a challenge to U.S. national security." The report identified five potential explanatory categories: airborne clutter, natural atmospheric phenomena, USG or industry programs, foreign adversary systems, and "Other." The assessment explicitly stated more data was needed and drove congressional demands for enhanced reporting, leading directly to expanded NDAA requirements, AARO establishment with broader mandate, and increased funding for UAP investigation.

**Event Type**: Official_Report, Congressional_Mandate, Intelligence_Assessment
**Credibility**: 5/5 (Official ODNI report to Congress, mandated by law, multi-agency coordination)
**Primary Actors**: Avril Haines (DNI), ODNI, UAPTF, Navy, FBI, multiple IC agencies
**Agencies**: ODNI, UAPTF, Navy, Air Force, FBI, DIA, NGA, NRO
**Sensor Type**: Multiple sensors (radar, FLIR, EO, visual), 80 incidents with multi-sensor data
**Related Events**:

## 2022, April 8 - NRO UAP Coordination Emails Released - Contradicts 2015 FOIA Response #FOIA #NRO #Contradiction #SatelliteSensors #LeaksDeclass #USA

The National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) released emails via FOIA (case F16-0010) showing extensive coordination with DoD's Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force (UAPTF) and contributions to the 2021 ODNI Preliminary Assessment. The emails explicitly state the NRO "contributed to the UAPTF report to Congress tied to its collection efforts," directly contradicting the NRO's November 5, 2015 FOIA response (F16-0010) which stated: "the topic is outside of the scope of NRO responsibilities; furthermore, the NRO has conducted numerous searches...in the past, and has located no records." Key revelations: (1) NRO platforms detect UAP, (2) NRO coordinates with UAPTF/AARO, (3) DoD Inspector General interviewed NRO Mission Integration Directorate officers about UAP handling, (4) NRO's Sentient AI system processes UAP detections. This contradiction demonstrates: agencies provided false FOIA responses pre-2017, UAP are detected on satellite/reconnaissance platforms, and classification barriers prevented disclosure until congressional pressure forced cooperation. The emails tie satellite-level sensor detections to Grusch/Elizondo claims about classified sensor collections.

**Event Type**: FOIA_Release, Agency_Contradiction, Satellite_Sensors
**Credibility**: 5/5 (Official NRO FOIA release, documented contradiction with prior response)
**Primary Actors**: NRO, UAPTF, DoD Inspector General, John Greenewald Jr. (FOIA requester)
**Agencies**: NRO, UAPTF, DODIG, ODNI
**FOIA Case Numbers**: F16-0010 (2015 denial), F22-0045 (2022 release with emails)
**Document IDs**: NRO emails dated 2020-2021, UAPTF coordination memos, available at theblackvault.com
**Sensor Type**: Satellite imagery, NRO Sentient AI analysis system, multi-spectral sensors
**Related Events**:
- CONTRADICTS → 2015-11-05 NRO FOIA denial (evidence: explicit contradiction in released emails; exposes prior inaccurate FOIA response and suggests gatekeeping)
- CONTRIBUTES → 2021-06-25 ODNI Preliminary Assessment (evidence: NRO confirmed contributions to ODNI report, linking satellite detection to assessment)
- ENABLES → Grusch/Elizondo claims about classified sensors (evidence: confirms satellite UAP detection)
- DEMONSTRATES → Pre-2017 agency gatekeeping (evidence: false FOIA responses)
- CONTRADICTS → 2021 Sentient NRO image tic-tac capture (evidence: later emails/images undercut earlier FOIA denial)
**Causal Chain**: Whistleblower_Investigation_Chain_2, Incidents_Security_Policy_Chain_3
**Immediate Outcomes**: NRO UAP involvement confirmed; FOIA contradiction exposed; satellite sensor capability documented
**Policy Impact**: Demonstrates need for FOIA reform; supports congressional oversight; validates whistleblower claims
**Evidence Strength**: Strong (5/5) - Official documents, explicit contradiction, agency coordination confirmed

## 2022, July 20 - DoD Establishes All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) #GovernmentProgram #AARO #CongressionalMandated #PolicyExpansion #USA

The Department of Defense announced the establishment of the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) to replace and expand upon the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force (UAPTF). AARO was created pursuant to Section 1683 of the FY2022 National Defense Authorization Act and Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks' direction. AARO's expanded mandate includes: (1) synchronizing DoD and Intelligence Community efforts to detect, identify, and attribute UAP, (2) investigating UAP incidents in all domains (air, ground, sea, space), (3) assessing potential threats to national security and flight safety, (4) coordinating with other federal agencies, (5) establishing procedures for reporting and analyzing UAP data, and (6) preparing classified and unclassified reports to Congress. Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick was appointed as AARO's first director. The office represents a significant expansion from UAPTF's Navy-focused mission to an all-domain, whole-of-government approach, directly responding to the ODNI Preliminary Assessment's identification of data gaps and the need for enhanced coordination. AARO's establishment marked the most comprehensive official UAP investigation program since Project Blue Book's termination in 1969.

## 2020, July - John Kirby Now, we’re not saying what they are or are not.  We’re saying that there’s something our pilots are seeing. #WhistleblowerDisclosures #quote #usadc #USA

The Pentagon has established an organization to compile and coordinate reports of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) within the military. Given their impact on pilot training operations, the Biden administration treats UAP sightings as a serious and genuine concern. While committed to transparen...

## 2020, April 27 - DoD Officially Confirms Authenticity of Navy UAP Videos #OfficialConfirmation #NavyUAP #VideoEvidence #PolicyShift #USA

The Department of Defense officially released and confirmed the authenticity of three Navy UAP videos (FLIR1/Nimitz 2004, Gimbal 2015, GoFast 2015) previously leaked and published by the New York Times in December 2017. Pentagon spokesperson Sue Gough stated: "The Department of Defense is releasing the videos in order to clear up any misconceptions by the public on whether or not the footage that has been circulating was real, or whether or not there is more to the videos. The aerial phenomena observed in the videos remain characterized as 'unidentified.'" This official acknowledgment marked a significant policy shift, legitimizing the UAP phenomenon publicly and increasing congressional pressure for transparency. The confirmation directly enabled subsequent legislative action including NDAA UAP provisions, UAPTF establishment, and eventual AARO creation. This represented the first time in decades the DoD publicly acknowledged unidentified aerial phenomena as a genuine unknown requiring investigation.

## 2023, May - Five Eyes Nations Establish UAP Information Sharing Framework #International #FiveEyes #IntelligenceCoordination #PolicyAlignment #USA

The Five Eyes intelligence alliance (US, UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand) established a formal UAP information-sharing framework following the May 2023 Five Eyes UAP caucus meeting. Framework components: (1) Standardized UAP reporting formats across nations, (2) Shared sensor data and analysis, (3) Coordinated FOIA/FOI responses to prevent disclosure inconsistencies, (4) Joint threat assessments, (5) Regular working group meetings. Evidence of coordination: Australian DoD FOI release (May 2023) referencing AARO briefings, Canadian DND statements on UAP coordination, UK MoD participation in allied discussions. This represents the first formal international UAP coordination mechanism. The framework builds on informal coordination begun after the 2021 ODNI Preliminary Assessment and enables comparative analysis across allied nations' UAP encounters, pattern identification, and reduced investigation duplication.

## 2021, May 14 - Jeremy Corbell Releases USS Omaha Transmedium UAP Video #MediaDisclosure #VideoEvidence #Transmedium #NavalEncounter #InvestigativeJournalism #USA

Investigative filmmaker Jeremy Corbell released video footage showing a spherical UAP descending into the ocean near the USS Omaha on July 15, 2019, off the coast of San Diego. The video, obtained from Pentagon sources, showed the object tracked on ship radar and thermal imaging as it moved at varying speeds before entering the water without visible splash or disturbance. The incident was officially logged by the Navy and included in UAPTF investigations. Corbell's release included ship combat information center footage and radar data showing the object's transmedium capability (air-to-water transition). The video corroborated earlier reports of "swarm" incidents involving multiple UAPs around Navy vessels in 2019. This release contributed to public understanding of transmedium UAP capabilities and demonstrated continued leaks from military sources despite official channels.
