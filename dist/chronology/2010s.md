# UAP/UFO Chronology - 2010s

## 2019, April 30 - LLNL Metallic Sphere UAP Incursion - PFD Operations Report #190430-13 #NuclearSite #DOE #SecurityIncident #AtomicEnergyAct #SensorEvidence #USA

Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) Protective Force Division (PFD) documented a UAP incursion involving metallic spheres observed over the nuclear facility on April 30, 2019. Official incident report: PFD Operations Report #190430-13, released by DOE via FOIA in August 2023. Key details: (1) Multiple metallic spherical objects observed by security personnel, (2) Objects exhibited controlled flight patterns over sensitive nuclear research areas, (3) Incident logged in official security records, (4) No conventional aircraft identification, (5) Event occurred during daylight hours with multiple witnesses. This incident demonstrates the nuclear-site UAP pattern documented at DOE facilities including Los Alamos, Oak Ridge, Savannah River, and Hanford. The Atomic Energy Act classification authority was invoked to withhold additional details, as referenced by Rep. Anna Paulina Luna during May 23, 2024 House Oversight hearing with DOE Secretary Jennifer Granholm. The PFD report number provides traceable documentation of UAP activity at critical nuclear infrastructure, supporting Grusch/Elizondo testimony about UAP interest in nuclear facilities and explaining why DOE uses Atomic Energy Act to classify UAP records.

## 2019, August 8 - To The Stars Academy of Arts & Science (TTSA), advised by current and former USG/USG contractor officials, announces a "technical collaboration" with Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Bigelow Aerospace and BAE Systems. It is seemingly published by mistake and removed from Instagram soon after it goes live. A technical collaboration with these aerospace contractors is never mentioned in TTSA's public SEC filings, nor has TTSA ever mentioned working with Boeing or BAE. Lockheed Martin Skunk Works veteran Steve Justice was TTSA's Aerospace Division #LeaksDeclass #social #news #rumor #usa #USA

## 2019, April 24 - Navy Establishes New UAP Reporting Guidelines #MilitaryPolicy #ReportingProcedures #StigmaReduction #USA

The U.S. Navy established formal guidelines for pilots and personnel to report Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) encounters, marking a significant policy shift following increased public and congressional attention from the 2017 NYT AATIP disclosure. Navy spokesperson Joseph Gradisher stated the new reporting mechanism was created because "there have been a number of reports of unauthorized and/or unidentified aircraft entering various military-controlled ranges and designated air space in recent years." The guidelines aimed to reduce stigma around UAP reporting, standardize data collection, and ensure proper threat assessment. This policy change directly responded to pilot concerns about lack of formal reporting channels and represented the Navy's acknowledgment that UAP encounters posed potential safety and security issues requiring systematic investigation. The guidelines contributed to increased UAP reporting that informed the 2021 ODNI Preliminary Assessment.

## 2018-2019 - Linda Moulton Howe Antarctica Whistleblower Interview Cluster #WhistleblowerDisclosures #Antarctica #UnverifiedClaims #USA

Investigative journalist Linda Moulton Howe published a series of interviews (2018-2019) with alleged military personnel and contractors claiming knowledge of unusual discoveries and activities in Antarctica. Key claims from anonymous sources: (1) Disc-shaped craft emerging from or entering Antarctic ice, (2) Unusual structures or anomalies beneath ice sheet detected via radar/seismic surveys, (3) Classified operations in restricted zones, (4) Advanced technology inconsistent with known human capabilities, (5) Extensive underground facilities. Sources cited: Navy personnel, Air National Guard (Operation Deep Freeze), NSF contractors, alleged special access program participants. Credibility assessment: UNVERIFIED/WHISTLEBLOWER - anonymous sources, no documentary evidence, professional backgrounds claimed but unverified, consistency across sources noted but could indicate shared narrative. Significance: the interviews frequently cite Wilkes Land magnetic anomaly, IceCube facility, Operation Highjump, and Operation Deep Freeze as context, demonstrating how verified scientific/operational facts are used to support unverified claims. This is a key example of "motivating/used by" relationship rather than proof.

**Event Type**: Whistleblower_Interviews, Unverified_Claims, Anonymous_Sources
**Credibility**: 2/5 UNVERIFIED/WHISTLEBLOWER (Anonymous sources; no documentary evidence; professional backgrounds claimed but unverified; narrative consistency noted)
**Primary Actors**: Linda Moulton Howe (journalist), multiple anonymous alleged sources (military, contractors)
**Alleged Activities**: Disc craft sightings, subsurface structures, classified operations, advanced technology
**Sources Cited in Claims**: Wilkes Land anomaly, IceCube, Operation Deep Freeze, Operation Highjump
**FOIA Targets**: NSF contractor personnel lists 2018-2019; Operation Deep Freeze flight logs; station access records
**Related Events**:

- CITES → 1946-47 Operation Highjump (evidence: historical precedent invoked)
- CITES → 1955+ Operation Deep Freeze (evidence: logistics capability referenced)
- PART_OF → Antarctica leak cluster (evidence: contributes to Antarctic-UAP narrative)
**Causal Chain**: Antarctic_Anomaly_Cluster, Unverified_Leak_Cluster
**Immediate Outcomes**: Speculation amplified; Antarctic-UAP narrative strengthened; community interest increased
**Policy Impact**: None (unverified claims); adds to disclosure community narratives
**Evidence Strength**: Weak (2/5) - Anonymous sources, no verification; demonstrates how verified facts used to support unverified claims

## 2018 - Wilkes Land Magnetic/Gravity Anomaly Confirmed by NASA #ScientificStudies #Antarctica #GeophysicalAnomaly #VerifiedScience #International

NASA and international geophysical surveys confirmed a massive magnetic and gravity anomaly beneath the ice in Wilkes Land, East Antarctica. The anomaly, detected through satellite magnetometry and gravimetry, spans approximately 300 kilometers in diameter and exhibits signatures consistent with a massive metallic concentration or impact structure buried beneath 1-2 kilometers of ice. Scientific interpretation: likely a Permian-era asteroid impact crater (250+ million years old) with associated metallic ejecta, though the exact composition remains unconfirmed due to ice cover preventing direct sampling. The anomaly has been repeatedly cited in UAP/disclosure communities as potential evidence of a buried artificial structure, though scientific consensus attributes it to natural geological processes. Significance for UAP research: demonstrates Antarctica contains large unexplained geophysical signals that require investigation; deep ice preservation would maintain any artifacts for millions of years; the anomaly's scale and inaccessibility make it a persistent subject of speculation in retrieval/crash-site narratives.

**Event Type**: Scientific_Discovery, Geophysical_Anomaly, Antarctic_Research
**Credibility**: 5/5 VERIFIED/SCIENTIFIC (NASA/geophysical data confirmed; interpretation as natural formation is scientific consensus; speculation about artificial origin is unverified)
**Primary Actors**: NASA, international geophysical research teams, satellite surveys
**Agencies**: NASA, NSF, international Antarctic research programs
**Sensor Type**: Satellite magnetometry, gravimetry, radar ice-penetrating surveys
**FOIA Targets**: NASA/NOAA satellite tasking logs over Wilkes Land; NSF Antarctic research grants; radar survey data
**Related Events**:
- PROVIDES_CONTEXT_FOR → Antarctic-UAP narratives Linda Moulton Howe interviews/Barber retrieval claims/4chan leak (evidence: verifiable geophysical anomaly invoked by Antarctic narratives)
- CORRELATES_WITH → IceCube particle anomalies (evidence: both Antarctic scientific anomalies used in disclosure narratives)
- CITED_IN → 2018-2019 Linda Moulton Howe Antarctica whistleblower claims (evidence: anomaly frequently referenced as contextual anchor)
- PROVIDES_CONTEXT_FOR → Buried structure/crash retrieval claims (evidence: demonstrates large subsurface anomalies exist)
**Causal Chain**: Scientific_Legitimization_Chain_4, Antarctic_Anomaly_Cluster
**Immediate Outcomes**: Verified geophysical anomaly documented; scientific explanation proposed; disclosure community speculation
**Policy Impact**: Demonstrates need for Antarctic subsurface investigation; provides context for retrieval claims
**Evidence Strength**: Strong (5/5) for anomaly existence; Weak (1/5) for artificial origin claims

## 2017, December 16 - New York Times Reveals AATIP and Releases Navy UAP Videos #MediaDisclosure #AATIP #NavyUAP #Whistleblower #PoliticalPressure #USA

The New York Times published "Glowing Auras and 'Black Money': The Pentagon's Mysterious U.F.O. Program" by Helene Cooper, Ralph Blumenthal, and Leslie Kean, revealing the existence of the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP) and releasing three Navy UAP videos (FLIR1/Nimitz 2004, Gimbal 2015, GoFast 2015). The article disclosed that the $22 million program, funded at the request of Senator Harry Reid, operated from 2007-2012 within the Defense Intelligence Agency. Luis Elizondo, former AATIP director, resigned in protest over excessive secrecy and lack of resources, then joined To The Stars Academy to facilitate disclosure. This article catalyzed mainstream UAP coverage, legitimized the topic for serious discussion, and directly led to increased congressional pressure for transparency, Navy reporting guideline updates, and eventual creation of UAPTF and AARO. The videos showed objects performing maneuvers beyond known aerospace capabilities, captured by multiple military sensor systems.

## 2017, October 11 - To The Stars Academy (TTSA) Publicly Launched #Organization #Whistleblower #MediaDisclosure #PoliticalBridge #USA

To The Stars Academy of Arts & Science (TTSA) was publicly launched by Tom DeLonge with a team of former government and military officials including Luis Elizondo (former AATIP director), Christopher Mellon (former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence), Dr. Hal Puthoff (physicist), Jim Semivan (former CIA), and Steve Justice (former Lockheed Skunk Works). TTSA positioned itself as a bridge between whistleblowers, media, and government, facilitating UAP disclosure through public education, congressional briefings, and media releases. The organization played a crucial role in the 2017-2020 disclosure wave by: (1) providing institutional support for whistleblowers like Elizondo, (2) briefing Senate committees and helping "glue" DoD, IC, and Congress together (per DeLonge 2019), (3) releasing UAP videos and documentation, and (4) creating public pressure for government transparency. TTSA's activities directly enabled congressional action on UAP issues and contributed to UAPTF establishment and NDAA provisions.

The visit occurred during the final weeks of the Obama administration and coincided with the 2016 U.S. presidential election (November 8). Kerry's itinerary: McMurdo Station, South Pole Station, meetings with NSF scientists and international researchers on climate change. Official purpose: climate research diplomacy and Antarctic Treaty cooperation. The visit's timing (during election week) and high-level nature sparked speculation in disclosure communities about potential undisclosed purposes, though no evidence supports alternative explanations beyond the stated climate mission. Significance: demonstrates high-level U.S. government access to Antarctic infrastructure; shows continuity of U.S. Antarctic operations; frequently cited in disclosure narratives as potentially related to discoveries or activities, though this remains speculative.

## 2013, June 21 - UK MoD Releases Major Batch of Declassified UFO Files (52 Files, 8,500 Pages) #International #FOIA #UKMoD #Europe #UnitedKingdom

The UK Ministry of Defence released 52 files (8,500 pages) to the National Archives, part of the ongoing disclosure program begun in 2008. File series released: DEFE 24/1929-1980 (1985-1995 period), including military pilot reports, radar tracking data, and UFO policy correspondence. Key documented cases: Multiple RAF pilot encounters with unidentified objects, radar-visual confirmations, Rendlesham Forest incident supplementary files (DEFE 24/1948-1950), and internal MoD debates about resource allocation. The files show MoD's gradual policy shift toward closure, with internal memos citing "lack of defence significance" despite 5-10% of cases remaining unexplained. Notable file DEFE 24/1972 contains 1993 policy review recommending desk closure. This release provided primary-document evidence of UK government UAP policy evolution 1985-1995.

## 2016-2018 - IceCube Neutrino Observatory Reports Anomalous Upward-Going High-Energy Events #ScientificStudies #Antarctica #ParticlePhysics #VerifiedScience #International

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory at Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station detected anomalous upward-traveling high-energy particle events that challenged standard physics models. Between 2016-2018, the detector recorded multiple instances of particles appearing to travel upward through Earth rather than downward from cosmic sources as expected. Scientific interpretation: these events may represent tau neutrinos produced by cosmic ray interactions, exotic particle physics, or detector artifacts requiring further study. The anomalies remain under investigation by the IceCube collaboration. Significance for UAP research: the anomalous particle detections have been referenced in disclosure communities as potential evidence of unusual physics phenomena in Antarctica, though scientific consensus attributes them to known (if rare) particle physics processes. The events demonstrate that Antarctica hosts sensitive scientific instruments capable of detecting unexpected phenomena, relevant to claims about unusual activities or physics in the region.

**Event Type**: Scientific_Anomaly, Particle_Physics, Antarctic_Research
**Credibility**: 5/5 VERIFIED/SCIENTIFIC (IceCube detections confirmed; scientific interpretation ongoing; speculation about NHI connection is unverified)
**Primary Actors**: IceCube Collaboration, NSF, University of Wisconsin-Madison, international physics teams
**Agencies**: NSF, U.S. Antarctic Program, international research institutions
**Sensor Type**: Neutrino detector array (5,000+ optical sensors in Antarctic ice)
**FOIA Targets**: IceCube data publications; NSF Antarctic Program station logs; detector maintenance records for 2016-2018
**Related Events**:
- CORRELATES_WITH → Wilkes Land magnetic anomaly (evidence: both Antarctic scientific anomalies cited in disclosure narratives)
- PROVIDES_CONTEXT_FOR → Antarctica whistleblower cluster 2018-2019 Linda Moulton Howe (evidence: IceCube physics anomalies used as evidence-of-interest in region)
- CITED_IN → Disclosure community Antarctic interest (evidence: IceCube anomalies used as evidence-of-interest in region)
- DEMONSTRATES → Antarctica hosts sensitive detection capabilities (evidence: world-class particle physics facility)
**Causal Chain**: Scientific_Legitimization_Chain_4, Antarctic_Anomaly_Cluster
**Immediate Outcomes**: Anomalous particle events documented; scientific investigation ongoing; disclosure community interest
**Policy Impact**: Demonstrates Antarctic scientific infrastructure; provides context for claims about unusual phenomena
**Evidence Strength**: Strong (5/5) for particle detections; Weak (1/5) for NHI/UAP connection claims

## 2016 - New UFO image declassified by Department of Defense. #FOIA #iraq #MiddleEast

The Department of Defense has declassified a new UFO image showing a metallic-looking orb flying over Mosul, Iraq. The image was taken by a US spy plane in April 2016 and was part of a classified briefing video on UFOs presented to various US government agencies.

## 2015, November 5 - The National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) states in response to a FOIA request that it has no documentation related to UFOs. It states the topic is "outside of the scope of NRO responsibilities; furthermore, the NRO has conducted numerous searches…in the past, and has located no records." This contradicts emails released by the NRO on 8 April 2022, which show extensive coordination with the DOD's Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force (UAPTF), and states the NRO contributed to the UAPTF report to Congress "tied to its collection efforts." This implies UAP are being detected on NRO platforms, and suggests the FOIA response in 2015 wasn't accurate if they were being detected in 2015 or before. #FOIA #USA

Note: The emails also reveal the DOD Inspector General (DOD/IG) interviewed several officers from the NRO Mission Integration Directorate (MID) connected to the IG’s evaluation of DOD handling/response to the UAP subject.

## 2015, March 13 - Kit Green states the records of Ret. USAF John Burroughs, Rendlesham Forest incident witness, were legally classified by the DOD. Green states only a handful of medical records were classified and the reasons were because inside the doctors notes, nursing, etc. are a “myriad of references to Special Access Projects” and the names of other adjacent and ancillary programs and projects that can not be disentangled and could uncover active/recent projects related to Rendlesham. Green states broadband non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation caused the injuries, the data is sparse and it is not well understood or peer reviewed. #HistoricalPreModern? #FOIA #ClassifiedRecords #Rendlesham #UAPRecordsCollection #USA

## 2015, March 6 - Former USG contractor Bob Fish tells Clinton campaign manager John Podesta that in a TS/SCI organization in El Segundo, CA, he had lunch with a senior USAF NCO who worked for Project Blue Book in the 1970s after it had publicly disbanded. He was an ELINT technician who flew in RC-135s from MacDill AFB in Florida. He allegedly told Fish they were sometimes diverted to track UAP off the east coast of Florida; the UAP allegedly came from a hotspot east of Miami, north of Bermuda. A specific frequency emanated from them, and UAP evidence was sent to a “dedicated” USAF intelligence officer. #rumor #wiki #ysacalifornia #USA

## 2012 - Author Bryce Zabel tells a story told to him by Brent Friedman, the alleged neighbor of former Secretary of Energy John S. Herrington (under the Reagan administration). Herrington allegedly stated he had been briefed for several weeks at an underground facility outside of Washington, D.C. and the information learned caused him to “cry himself to sleep for a number of nights.” When asked why, Herrington allegedly stated “there is intelligent life in the universe; it’s here and I’ve seen it; this is not the kind of world I thought \[my children\] would grow up in.” #rumor#USA

Herrington also allegedly stated the existence of extraterrestrials were the “tip of the iceberg” in terms of the revelations he learned related to the issue.

## 2011, June - DHS officials Jim Bell and Sacha Mover begin a series of other meetings in the U.S. intelligence community beyond DHS to determine if they can set up BAASS as a UAP analysis program within DHS Science & Technology (S&T). Those men are the “keepers of the secrets,” who treat Bell and Mover rudely and told “no, and hell no” when asked. Bell and Mover later told BAASS that they believed advanced technology was being held at aerospace contractor facilities under government supervision. Mover and Bell became fearful of moving forward. By late 2011, DHS Deputy Secretary Jane Holl Lute, Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis Phyllis Green, and others decided not to contract BAASS within DHS. #LegislationPolicy #AgencyCoordination #GovernmentPolicy #UAPResearch #FOIARelease? #USA
