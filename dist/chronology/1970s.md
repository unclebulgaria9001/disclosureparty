# UAP/UFO Chronology - 1970s

## 1977 - Attorney Daniel P. Sheehan, at the request of Congressional Research Service researcher Marcia S. Smith, claims to visit the Madison Building at the Library of Congress to look at “classified sections of Project Blue Book.” Sheehan claims to see photos of a flying disc embedded in snow surrounded by USAF personnel wearing parkas. Symbols are present on the side of the crashed disc. If true, this contradicts the findings of the Blue Book that were delivered to Congress and the American people, stating that a lack of physical evidence was a key reason why UAP was not worthy of future study. #MilitaryEncounters #UnderwaterUSO? #MassSighting #PhysicalEffects #HistoricalPreModern #Declassified #USA

## 1977, February 4 - Broad Haven School UFO Sighting #CivilianSightings #MultipleWitness #ContactAttempt #Inbound #HistoricalPreModern #Europe #UnitedKingdom #Wales #Pembrokeshire #BroadHaven

On February 4, 1977, a yellow cigar-shaped craft was claimed to have landed in a field next to Broadhaven Primary School in Broad Haven, Pembrokeshire, Wales. A group of 14 children claimed to have observed the craft and a silver creature. The headmaster, believing this to be a practical joke, made each child independently draw what they had seen. The resulting pictures were all nearly identical, showing the same cigar-shaped object. This incident is similar to the 1994 Ariel School Incident in Zimbabwe. The entire Pembrokeshire area was inundated with UFO sightings, cryptid reports, and Men in Black encounters throughout 1977, making it one of the UK's most concentrated UFO flaps in UK history.
