**Details:**

3\. 50 years later they said that they lied to the public and that it was Mogul balloon, except that according to official documentation and testimony of Albert Crary flight no. 4 allegely responsible for Roswell incident was never launched with full equipment. 
4\. They also lied that eyewitnesses confused crashed test dummies with alien bodies, except that those dummies were used for the first time in 1950s.
5\. Dozens eyewitnesses who saw craft and pieces - Jesse Marcel, Jesse Marcel Jr, Walter Haut, Lewis Rickett, Robert Shirkey, Robert Smith, Bill Brazel Jr, George Wilcox, Frankie Rowe, Robert Slasher, Robert Porter, Edwin Easley, Steven Lovekin, June Crain, Loretta Proctor, Dean Proctor, Rolland Menagh, Richard Talbert, Earl Fulford. Most of them wrote affidavits about it.
6\. There are firsthand eyewitnesses to the bodies - Walter Haut, Eleazar Benevidez, Frederick Benthal, Philip Corso, Patrick Saunders. 
7\. People who admit to cover up - Arthur Exon, Thomas DuBose, Walter Haut, Chase Brandon.
It boggles my mind how most people never heard of any of that and instead they just accept lies and misleading statements that apparently there were only second hand stories and that everything was explained.

## 1946-1947 - Operation Highjump (US Navy Antarctic Expedition) #MilitaryOperations #HistoricalPreModern #Antarctica #VerifiedOperation #USA

Operation Highjump (US Navy Antarctic Developments Program) was the largest Antarctic expedition in history, led by Admiral Richard E. Byrd. Launched August 1946, the operation deployed 4,700 personnel, 13 ships, and 33 aircraft across three task forces. Mission objectives: extensive aerial photography/mapping, testing equipment in extreme conditions, establishing Little America IV base, and training personnel for polar operations. The operation was scheduled for 6-8 months but terminated in February 1947 after approximately 8 weeks. Official reasons: severe weather, equipment failures, aircraft losses. The early termination and subsequent classification of certain operational details sparked decades of speculation in UAP/disclosure communities about potential "encounters," though no credible evidence supports extraordinary claims. Operation facts are well-documented; later interpretations about discoveries or conflicts are speculative. Historical significance: established US Antarctic presence; provided baseline for future operations; became foundational narrative in Antarctic-UAP speculation.

**Event Type**: Military_Operation, Antarctic_Expedition, Historical_Record
**Credibility**: 5/5 VERIFIED/OFFICIAL for operation facts; 1/5 SPECULATIVE for "encounter" claims
**Primary Actors**: Admiral Richard E. Byrd, US Navy, 4,700 personnel
**Agencies**: US Navy, Department of Defense
**FOIA Targets**: Navy after-action reports; classified operational annexes; Byrd debriefing transcripts; aircraft loss investigations
**Related Events**:
- PRECEDES → 1947-03 Byrd post-expedition statements (evidence: Byrd press conferences followed operation)

## 1947, March - Admiral Byrd Post-Expedition Statements #HistoricalPreModern #Antarctica #ContestedQuotes #USA

Following Operation Highjump's February 1947 termination, Admiral Richard E. Byrd allegedly made statements during press conferences warning about polar threats. Most commonly cited quote: "the United States should prepare for the possibility of aircraft that can fly from pole to pole at incredible speeds." Credibility assessment: the exact wording, context, and even existence of these specific statements remain disputed and unverified in official records. Some accounts cite Chilean newspaper El Mercurio (March 5, 1947), but primary source verification is lacking. Byrd's documented post-expedition activities show continued advocacy for Antarctic research and Cold War strategic importance of polar regions, which may be the actual context for any aircraft-related statements (i.e., Soviet bomber threats via polar routes). Significance: these alleged statements became foundational to Antarctic-UAP narratives despite questionable sourcing. They are frequently cited as "Byrd warnings" about discoveries, though credible evidence is absent.

**Event Type**: Alleged_Statements, Historical_Narrative, Contested_Source
**Credibility**: 2/5 DOCUMENTED BUT CONTESTED (Some contemporary accounts exist; exact quotes unverified; context disputed; widely cited but poorly sourced)
**Primary Actors**: Admiral Richard E. Byrd, press conferences, alleged newspaper accounts
**FOIA Targets**: Byrd press conference transcripts March 1947; El Mercurio archives; Navy debriefing records; State Department cables
**Related Events**:
- FOLLOWS → 1946-47 Operation Highjump (evidence: statements allegedly made post-expedition)
- CITED_IN → Modern Antarctic-UAP narratives (evidence: foundational "warning" narrative)
- MOTIVATES → Speculation about Highjump discoveries (evidence: statements used as evidence)
**Causal Chain**: Antarctic_Anomaly_Cluster, Historical_Antarctic_Operations
**Immediate Outcomes**: Speculation generated; narrative foundation established; quotes widely circulated
**Policy Impact**: Minimal direct impact; significant narrative impact in disclosure communities
**Evidence Strength**: Weak (2/5) - Poorly sourced; context disputed; likely misinterpreted Cold War strategic statements

## 1947, March 25 - Navy Secretary Forrestal Begins Recruiting "Outstanding Administrators" #MilitaryPrograms #ClassifiedRecords #GovernmentPolicy #LeaksDeclass #Navy #HistoricalPreModern #USA

Three months before Roswell, Navy Secretary James Forrestal drafted a confidential form letter to Naval District Commanders requesting names of "outstanding administrators"—men between 30 and 50, proven, discreet, successful in business, and financially independent enough to accept temporary government service. Political affiliation was explicitly irrelevant. The individuals themselves were not to be informed their names were being submitted. Forrestal specified approximately fifteen candidates as a practical buffer, creating a small personal bench outside normal chains of visibility. Over six days, Forrestal revised the letter twice (March 27 and March 31), finalizing it as standing policy by month's end. A classified Army Air Forces memo dated September 22, 1947 by Lt. Col. Tucker retrospectively references two incidents involving "loaned S-Aircraft" on March 25, 1947 and July 4, 1947, focusing on decompression, radiation exposure, pilot fatalities, and instrumentation limits. The documents reflect different parts of the defense establishment independently adapting structures to manage experimental aircraft whose performance envelopes and physiological effects were not fully understood.

## 1944,  December 14 - New York Times: US Army Air Force reported they were encountering "silver colored spheres" in the air over German territory. The spheres are encountered either singly or in clusters, sometimes translucent #USA

1813, August 27 - Extraordinary phenomena in the sun On the morning of the 27th August, 1813, the Majestic being then off Boston, the men on board observed, at the rising of the sun, the complete figure of a man in the centre of that luminary, with a flag divided by three lines, in his hand. He w...

**Details:**

The American papers, we believe, notice only the extraordinary appearance of the Sun on the above mentioned days. Perhaps the observers on that continent were not in a position to catch the precise appearance which the particles of matter presented to the ship’s company of the Majestic.
There could be no optical delusion on the occasion, as the phenomenon was observed by so many different eyes, and for so long a time. The first figure was seen during the whole of the 27th, the skeleton the whole of the 28th, and the six flags during a great part of the 29th.
The above is an occurrence that may merit the attention of the philosophic. It is singular, we conceive, but nothing miraculous or portentous. Indeed, as the sun is the centre of a system of planets, several of which are much larger and probably more important than ours, we do not know why the common luminary should shape his face, or have it shaped for him, so as to indicate the particular occurrences on this earth.
The sun is, no doubt, a material luminous body—perhaps liable to an internal irregular motion of tis parts; at least, this phenomenon would seem to prove it so; and most people have observed how frequently the ignited cinders of a common fire present, at different times, the various appearances of men, trees, horses, houses &c.,
The evidence, however, for the phenomenon itself, we must again add, is of the most undoubted and respectable kind. We have seen, and have by us, copies of drawings made by Captain Hayes on the occasion.
On December 13th, at Supreme Headquarters, Allied Expeditionary Force, a startling revelation emerged regarding a novel German weapon on the western air front. American Air Force pilots reported their encounters with enigmatic silver spheres hovering over German territory. These spheres appeared either as solitary orbs or in mysterious clusters, occasionally displaying a semi-translucent quality. This astonishing development, dubbed a "secret" weapon, coincided curiously with the Christmas season, resembling the festive glass balls adorning Christmas trees. However, the true nature of these enigmatic spheres remained uncertain, as there was no available information regarding how they remained suspended in the sky, what they contained, or the purpose they were intended to serve. The floating mystery ball had become a perplexing and mystifying addition to the unfolding wartime narrative.
