# UAP/UFO Chronology - 1950s

## 1952, March 25 - Project Blue Book Established by US Air Force #GovernmentProgram #MilitaryInvestigation #HistoricalPreModern #USA

The United States Air Force established Project Blue Book on March 25, 1952, as the third and most extensive official U.S. government investigation into unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The program succeeded Projects Sign (1947-1949) and Grudge (1949-1952). Headquartered at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, Project Blue Book was tasked with determining if UFOs posed a threat to national security and to scientifically analyze UFO-related data. The project was directed by several officers over its 17-year span, most notably Captain Edward J. Ruppelt (1952-1953) who coined the term "UFO" to replace "flying saucer." Project Blue Book investigated 12,618 UFO sightings before its termination in 1969, classifying cases as "identified" (known objects/phenomena), "insufficient information," or "unidentified" (701 cases, 5.6% of total). The program's methods and conclusions have been debated, with critics alleging cases were dismissed without proper investigation to reduce public concern.

**Event Type**: Program_Creation, Military_Investigation
**Credibility**: 5/5 (Official Air Force program, extensive documentation, declassified records)
**Related Events**: Succeeds Project Sign and Project Grudge; terminated 1969 following Condon Report; influences modern AATIP/AARO programs
**Causal Impact**: Established first systematic government UAP investigation framework; created classification and analysis protocols; generated extensive case files used by later researchers

## 1957 - Levelland #HistoricalPreModern #USA

In the film Close Encounters of the Third Kind, there’s a famous scene where a UFO makes the electronics in a car go haywire. The real-life inspiration for that scene came from an incident in 1957, when dozens of citizens of Levelland, Texas, individually reported seeing a rocket or strange light...

## 1956, October 24 - The National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) is an unidentified flying object (UFO) research group that was most active in the United States from the 1950s to the 1980s. It remains active primarily as an informational depository on the UFO phenomenon. #CivilianOrganizations #HistoricalPreModern #UFOResearch #Advocacy #USA

NICAP was a non-profit organization and faced financial collapse many times in its existence, due in no small part to business ineptitude among the group's directors. Following a wave of nationally publicized UFO incidents in the mid-1960s, NICAP's membership spiked dramatically and only then did...

## 1955-Present - Operation Deep Freeze (Continuous US Military Antarctic Logistics) #MilitaryOperations #Antarctica #LogisticsSupport #VerifiedOperation #USA

Operation Deep Freeze is the codename for continuous United States military logistical support to Antarctica, beginning in 1955 and ongoing to present. Initially established to support the International Geophysical Year (1957-1958), the operation provides year-round military airlift, sealift, and logistics for the National Science Foundation's United States Antarctic Program (USAP). Key capabilities: C-130 and C-17 airlift from Christchurch NZ to McMurdo Station, LC-130 ski-equipped aircraft for inland stations, icebreaker support, helicopter operations, construction and maintenance. The operation maintains three major US stations: McMurdo Station (logistics hub), Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, and Palmer Station. Military assets include Air National Guard 109th Airlift Wing, Navy cargo handling, and contractor support (Lockheed Martin, Leidos, others). Significance for UAP research: demonstrates continuous US military access and logistical capability in Antarctica, including helicopter long-sling operations similar to those described in retrieval claims; shows military-contractor coordination in remote operations; provides context for high-level visits (Kerry 2016) and potential covert activities under scientific cover.

**Event Type**: Military_Operation, Logistics_Support, Ongoing_Program
**Credibility**: 5/5 VERIFIED/OFFICIAL (Continuous documented operation; public mission; classified operational details exist)
**Primary Actors**: US Navy, Air National Guard, NSF, military contractors (Lockheed Martin, Leidos)
**Agencies**: US Navy, USAF, Air National Guard, NSF, Department of Defense
**Logistics Capabilities**: C-130/C-17 airlift, LC-130 ski ops, helicopters, icebreakers, heavy equipment
**FOIA Targets**: Navy/USAF flight logs; contractor task orders; station manifests; classified operational annexes
**Related Events**:
- ENABLED_BY → 1946-47 Operation Highjump (evidence: established operational precedent)
- SUPPORTS → 2016-11-10 Kerry Antarctica visit (evidence: military transport provided)
- DEMONSTRATES → Military logistics capability for retrievals (evidence: helicopter/airlift assets)
- ENABLES → Continuous military-contractor presence (evidence: Lockheed Martin, Leidos support)
**Causal Chain**: Antarctic_Anomaly_Cluster, Military_Logistics_Pattern, Retrieval_Operations_Context
**Immediate Outcomes**: Continuous US Antarctic presence; military-scientific coordination; logistics infrastructure
**Policy Impact**: Enables Antarctic research; provides military access; demonstrates retrieval capability
**Evidence Strength**: Strong (5/5) for operation facts; logistics capability relevant to retrieval claims

**Details:**

Battelle is highlighted as a significant organization involved in various sectors, including defense and science. The post also notes its connections to government agencies, its status as a 501(c)(3) organization, and its control over various national laboratories. The analysis further points out connections between the report's findings and the characteristics of the Roswell crash metal, including its "shape memory" properties. General Arthur Exon's testimony and General George Schulgen's memo, along with other military studies on memory metals, are discussed as supportive evidence.
Dr. Howard C. Cross, a Battelle scientist, is identified as a key figure in UFO research for government agencies and top-secret Titanium alloy studies. The possibility of Battelle's advanced arc furnace's role in creating Nitinol memory metal is raised. The post also delves into Dr. Edgar Mitchell's statements about a "semi or quasi-private organization" involved in UFO secrecy, which the author connects to Battelle due to its characteristics and involvement in UFO-related projects. Overall, the post presents a detailed analysis of documents, reports, and statements to establish the connection between Battelle Memorial Institute and its role in analyzing materials from the Roswell UFO crash.
