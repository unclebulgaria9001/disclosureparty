- Corbell releases → Public pressure → Navy confirmations
- Coulthart investigations → Grusch testimony → Congressional hearings
**Status**: Framework established, needs additional entries

#### Chain 3: Incidents → Security → Policy (PARTIALLY DOCUMENTED)
- Navy encounters → Reporting guidelines → UAPTF → ODNI assessment → AARO
**Status**: Framework established, needs DOE/nuclear site incident details

#### Chain 4: Scientific Legitimization (FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHED)
- DoD acknowledgment → NASA involvement → Civilian research
**Status**: Needs NASA Independent Study Team entry

#### Chain 5: International Coordination (DOCUMENTED)
- US ODNI report → Five Eyes interest → Formal framework → Coordinated investigations
**Evidence**: UK releases, Five Eyes framework, international statements
